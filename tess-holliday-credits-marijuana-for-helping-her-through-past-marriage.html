Tess, 38, exclusively spoke to Us Weekly about the difficult dissolution of her relationship with ex-husband Nick Holliday, from whom she split in 2019.
“It was so hard to push through it,” she admitted. “That was such a dark, dark time in my life and there’s parts of it that I don’t even really remember because I was just so focused on getting out of the situation."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Tess has full custody of their son, <strong>Bowie</strong>, 8, and she is also the mother of son <strong>Rylee</strong>, 18, from a previous relationship.</p><p>To help navigate the chaos, Tess turned to a new kind of coping mechanism. “Medical marijuana, man,” she gushed.</p><p>“I had never, ever used it before in my life,” she continued. “After I was done breastfeeding a year after giving birth, it allowed me to zone out and get through it a little bit.”</p><p>She also sought out the assistance of some professionals who ultimately helped her see the light.</p><p>“Therapy helped me immensely,” she said. “I had a postpartum therapist, and the therapist was like, ‘Hey, you know you’re in an abusive relationship, right?’ I was like ‘Oh, my God, I am.’ I was so out of it. It was having the therapist say that to me that snapped me back to reality.”</p><p>When it comes to <a href=#>future relationships</a>, Tess vowed “to never do anything that doesn’t align with my heart and soul, and to listen to my gut.”</p><p>In accordance with her partnership with Natural Cycles and Postpartum Support International, Tess recorded a PSA as part of their “Is Mommy Okay?” series — which also features videos from <strong>Elaine Welteroth</strong>, <strong>Halle Bailey</strong>,<strong> Ashley Tisdale</strong> and <strong>Stephanie Beatriz</strong>&nbsp; — in which she gets honest about feeling like a “prisoner” to postpartum depression.</p><p></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When Tess was asked to advocate for the cause, it was a no-brainer.</p><p>“Postpartum was extremely difficult for me,” she acknowledged. “I think for a while I was in denial with how bad my mental health was. Having help really empowered me to take care of myself, and I want that for others.”</p><p><i>With reporting by Amanda Williams</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnaOoeqm7y6WgnZmpYrCzscOiq6xlnZa%2FqrbUmqWaZZakv260xKWnoqaXYrWmvoytn6unpZy1brzArKtmpZGnv6qtxp5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
