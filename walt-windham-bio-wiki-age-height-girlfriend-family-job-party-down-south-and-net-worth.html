Party Down South is an American reality television series that aired on CMT produced and created by SallyAnn and 495 Productions. The series involves eight cast members together in one house for summer as they explore and carry on their lives on the beach. Party Down South was voted as the highest-rated show in 2014 with over 900,000 viewers.</p><p>The reality show started on 16 July 2014 and was canceled on 7 April 2016. There was no official statement on why CMT decided to cancel the show and fans have been left wondering if they will have another taste of their favorite reality show once again.</p><p>Previously, the cast has battled producers over pay disputes, and the show had to deal with the loss of one of the show’s highest-profile cast members, Taylor “Lil Bit” Wright who left after what she characterized as safety concerns. According to our sources, the cast members were paid just $500 apiece for each Season 1 episode, and so they were refused to return to the show unless they each earned $7,500.</p><h2 id=h-frequently-asked-questions-about-walt-windham><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-walt-windham></span><span><strong>Frequently Asked Questions About Walt Windham</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Walt Windham?<br></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Walt Windham is an American reality TV star who was born in Mississippi, United States of America.
