James Brown</strong></h2><p>He calls himself Soul Brother Number One. <a href=#>James Brown</a> was known for his</p><p>trademark vocal that featured an amazing range. He also had a scream that</p><p>sounded like a voice from within crying out for more. Brown was also more than</p><p>just his vocals. He had an awkward, beautiful dance that he branded as an African</p><p>nerve control. Whether it was ballads or uptempo, his songs always had an edge</p><p>into it. Born on May 3, 1933, Brown passed away on Christmas Day in 2006. Some</p><p>of his most famous songs are “I Got You (I Feel Good),” “The Payback,””Give It Up</p><p>or Turnit a Loose” and “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag.” He has influenced artists like</p><p><a href=#>Prince</a>, <a href=#>Iggy Pop</a>, <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>, <a href=#>Sly Stone</a> and <a href=#>George Clinton</a>.</p><h2 id=9-stevie-wonder><strong>9. Stevie Wonder</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Stevie Wonder</a>’s rich and clear voice evokes a joyful cry that everyone can hear.</p><p>He knew how to create an impact with his singing and his lyrics are very visual and</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>graphic. Such an irony for someone who is blind, but this disability is what probably</p><p>allowed him to heighten his other senses that made us see the imagery of his songs</p><p>so clearly. Some of his songs include “Superstition,” “Signed, Sealed and Delivered”</p><p>and “My Cherie Amour.” Born on May 13, 1950, he has influenced artists such as</p><p><a href=#>Cee-Lo</a>, <a href=#>Adam Levine</a> and Maxwell.</p><h2 id=8-otis-redding><strong>8. Otis Redding</strong></h2><p>Otis Redding started out as a driver for Johnny Jenkins. During an audition for Stax</p><p>Records in Memphis, he blew everyone away with his version of “These Arms of</p><p>Mine.” The amazing thing about Redding was that he actually possessed limited</p><p>range. He couldn’t go as low or as high as other singers. What he had plenty of,</p><p>however, was emotion that only came about when he was singing. Some of his</p><p>most famous songs include “(Sittin’ on) The Dock of the Bay” and “Try a Little</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tenderness.” He is a hero to the likes of <a href=#>Al Green</a>, <a href=#>Chris Robinson</a> and Toots</p><p>Hibbert.</p><h2 id=7-bob-dylan><strong>7. Bob Dylan</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Bob Dylan</a> is probably music’s version of <a href=#>Marlon Brando</a> in that they both dismissed</p><p>the cunning and deceit of their trade to get to the art. His voice is a combination of</p><p>cracked, yelp and howl, but it was exactly the reason why he could sing melancholic</p><p>songs without being corny and sentimental. His songs were raging and indignant</p><p>and he is considered as the Voice of a Generation. He sang “Like a Rolling Stone,”</p><p>probably the greatest song of all time. He has influenced artists like <a href=#>Bono</a>, <a href=#>John</a></p><p><a href=#>Lennon</a> and <a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a>.</p><h2 id=6-marvin-gaye><strong>6. Marvin Gaye</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Marvin Gaye</a> had the unique combination of soft and gentle singing backed up with</p><p>his powerful voice. He sang with honesty and emotion and it seemed that every song</p><p>he delivered came straight from the heart. Everything that was happening in his life</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>had an effect on his singing. None better capture that than “What’s Going On?” He</p><p>also sang “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.” He has influenced artists like <a href=#>R. Kelly</a>,</p><p><a href=#>Alicia Keys</a> and <a href=#>Usher</a>.</p><h2 id=5-john-lennon><strong>5. John Lennon</strong></h2><p><a href=#>John Lennon</a>’s songs were a product of his intellect and rendered by his intimate</p><p>voice. He sang “Imagine” in such a way that everyone listening to the song was</p><p>living in it, thinking and wishing exactly for what the lyrics were saying. His style</p><p>was straightforward, going directly to what he wanted to say. He gave us powerful</p><p>imageries with “Strawberry Fields Forever.” His influence on other musicians has</p><p>been profound, with artists like Bono, <a href=#>Jackson Browne</a>, <a href=#>Liam Gallagher</a> and <a href=#>Neil</a></p><p><a href=#>Young</a> looking up to him as a hero.</p><h2 id=4-sam-cooke><strong>4. Sam Cooke</strong></h2><p>When you listen to the songs of Sam Cooke, you could just feel him reaching down</p><p>to his very soul. He sang gospel style, meaning it was real, clean and direct. He</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>did not boast of an amazing range, but the totality of his singing is still considered</p><p>as one of the best because of his phrasing and power to deliver. Some of his most</p><p>memorable renditions have been of “Bring It On Home to Me,” “A Change is Gonna</p><p>Come” and “You Send Me.” He influenced other artists, like Otis Redding, <a href=#>Rod</a></p><p><a href=#>Stewart</a>, <a href=#>van Morrison</a> and <a href=#>Art Garfunkel</a>.</p><h2 id=3-elvis-presley><strong>3. Elvis Presley</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Elvis Presley</a> had a unique singing style that evoked confidence. He had the ability</p><p>to transform a song and treat even the tiniest note as his own. As a result, it would</p><p>be hard for other artists to even attempt a version of his songs. Can you imagine</p><p>anyone else singing “Hound Dog,” “Suspicious Minds,” “Jailhouse Rock” or “Love</p><p>Me Tender?” Some of the artists Presley has influenced include fellow influential</p><p>musicians themselves, like <a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a>, Bono and Led Zeppelin.</p><h2 id=2-ray-charles><strong>2. <a href=#>Ray Charles</a></strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No other singer could turn groans, whoops, grunts and yelps into actual music. He</p><p>was the epitome of an artist baring his soul through his singing. He had the most</p><p>unique voice and style, incorporating small laughs and adlibs into parts of the song.</p><p>Despite being blind, he had a gleeful style of singing that felt like he was actually</p><p>enjoying each and every performance he gave out. Some of his more memorable</p><p>songs are “What’d I Say, Pts. 1 & 2,” “You Don’t Know Me,” “I Got a Woman” and</p><p>“Georgia on My Mind.” He has influenced artists like <a href=#>Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=#>Billy Joel</a>, Otis</p><p>Redding and van Morrison.</p><h2 id=1-aretha-franklin><strong>1. Aretha Franklin</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Aretha Franklin</a> epitomized power and technique, blended with an honesty and</p><p>soulfulness that made her singing incomparable. Her deliveries allow listeners to</p><p>visualize what she is saying because of her clear expressions. Her songs have</p><p>remained favorites after all these years, including “Chain of Fools,” “Respect” and</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.” She influenced <a href=#>Whitney Houston</a>,</p><p><a href=#>Mary J. Blige</a>, Alicia Keys, <a href=#>Aaron Neville</a> and <a href=#>Annie Lennox</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatoJViwbC8jGpnZpqVqMFuv8innp6qo2K8p3nApaNmrJmisnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
