Jason and Travis’ parents, <strong>Ed Kelce </strong>and<strong> Donna Kelce,</strong> who Swift has spent time with at previous games, were also in the suite.</p><p>While there’s been conflicting opinions on how <a href=#>often the NFL showcases</a> Swift in the stands at Travis’ games, there was no shortage of sweet moments captured on Sunday. It was Jason, however, who made the most waves when he <a href=#>took his shirt off</a> (according to reports, it felt like 13 degrees in Buffalo) and climbed into the stands after Travis scored a touchdown in the second quarter.</p><p>Jason showed his support for Swift by “liking” a post on X that pointed out that it’s a double standard if fans like his actions but get annoyed at the league cutting to Swift during the broadcast. “Wondering if a cutaway of a shirtless @JasonKelce screaming and holding a beer to celebrate his brother’s touchdown is ruining anyone’s entertainment value of this game out there,” the post reads.</p><p>The Chiefs <a href=#>ultimately won 27-24</a> and are set to play the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, January 28.
