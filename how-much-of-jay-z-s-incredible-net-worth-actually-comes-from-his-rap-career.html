While Jay-Z has retired from making music, he is always looking for new things to invest in that will make him more money in the long run. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This success, in part, according to Jay-Z's financial manager and Jay-Z, himself, is not lending money to friends or family.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-does-jay-z-make-from-making-music>How Much Does Jay-Z Make From Making Music?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jay-z-spotted-in-nyc-2015-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Jay-Z has made $75 million from his music</strong></li></ul><p>It's estimated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z's music catalog has brought in over $75 million</a>. Jay-Z's rap career <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began in the late 80s in New York City.</a> The born and raised New Yorker found himself a mentor, rapper Jay-O and named himself in his honor, deriving the Z from his childhood nickname "Jazzy."</p><p>He began to perfect his craft in the halls of his high school, George Westinghouse High School, located in Brooklyn. He could often be found rapping in his school's cafeteria, where he frequently hosted competitions with fellow rappers in the community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things really began to pick up for Jay-Z in 1988 when he was flown to London by Jaz-O to help the rapper record his album.</p><p>After returning from London, he was a full-fledged music artist. He went on to travel the United States on Big Daddy Kane's tour bus and made his big debut in 1993, appearing on the remixed version of "Can I Get Open." By 1994, he was releasing his debut album with the help of his business partner and co-producer, Damon Dash.</p><p>Doubt was received well by fans and critics alike and helped encourage Jay-Z to form his own record label to ensure the most profits from his work. Roc-A-Fella records was created in 1996, but in 1997 the rapper chose to sing to Def Jam Recordings to release his second album, In My Lifetime Vol. 1.</p><p>A year later, he released his third and arguably most well-known album Vol. 2…Hard Knock Life. Jay-Z was declared a rap phenom, winning his first Grammy Award shortly after, and the rest is really history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-has-jay-z-made-from-his-business-ventures>How Much Has Jay-Z Made From His Business Ventures?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jay-z-ascap-rhythm-and-soul-music-awards.jpg><ul><li><strong>Jay-Z's investments total $200 million</strong></li></ul><p>Jay-Z became an avid businessman after his explosion in the rap world. After settling down with his wife, <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>, the rapper began looking into ways to expand his net worth outside of rapping.</p><p>Staying inside the world of music, <strong>he submitted a bid to purchase the Scandinavian streaming service Tidal for $60 million in 2015</strong>. Currently, his stake in the music streaming service, which he launched with the help of other music innovators such as Kanye West and Calvin Harris, <strong>is valued at around $100 million</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Forbes also estimates that Jay-Z has over $200 million in investments, which includes stocks, NFTS, and any cryptocurrency he might have.
