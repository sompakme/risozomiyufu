In the show, which centers around a family who lives a life of polygamy, audiences have become familiar with Kody Brown, his four wives, and their combined 18 children. While the family maintained their loyalty to plural marriage for many years, there were people in their lives who didn't support their marriages.</p><p>At one point in time, the wives and Kody were confronted by someone at a mutual event who held a very strong stance on the life choices that the family had adopted and voiced his displeasure while on camera. This individual challenged Kody with an idea that ultimately panned out. Did he predict the future of the Sister Wives family with his input? Or did Kody's behavior of not defending his family cause the outcome?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-everyone-was-impressed-with-kody-brown-39-s-polygamist-lifestyle>Not Everyone Was Impressed With Kody Brown's Polygamist Lifestyle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screen-shot-2020-03-09-at-5-07-57-am-1.png><p>The beginning of the Sister Wives series saw the family fleeing from their shared home in Utah amid arrest rumors that they would be prosecuted for their chosen lifestyle. After they settled in Las Vegas and began their new lives in the state of Nevada, the family began experiencing turmoil internally as well as externally, which followed the family as they later relocated to Arizona.</p><p>Not only were they surrounded by groups and individuals who didn't support the makeup of their family, but <a href=#>Kody himself was amassing a significant amount of debt</a> that had some of his wives frustrated and worried about their future and stability as a family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kody-brown-talking-with-his-hands-on-sister-wives.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Amid Arrest Rumors, Could Kody Brown Actually Be Prosecuted For His Sister Wives?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Polygamy is illegal in many places, but was Kody Brown actually close to getting arrested?</span><p>Having been used to comments and threats about their family for years, the Brown family grew accustomed to ignoring the behaviors and continuing with their lives. However, a friend of Kody's made a particularly hurtful statement that stopped the wives in their tracks.</p><p>This event resulted in multiple arguments and the possible demise of the family. What did this friend allege about the Brown family, and why did it resonate so strongly?</p><h2 id=kody-39-s-friend-once-warned-him-against-having-multiple-wives>Kody's Friend Once Warned Him Against Having Multiple Wives</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screen-shot-2021-04-04-at-5-19-19-pm.png><p>In a clip from an episode of the Sister Wives television show, Kody Brown and his wives are seen attending his high school reunion and sitting among other attendees. During their time at the event, a friend of Kody's, who goes by the name of Kyle, tells him that he disagrees with the plural lifestyle that Kody has taken on since high school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What's more, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle further asserts that Kody should leave three of his wives</a> to be welcomed back into the church they once shared.

In fact, he continued his relationship with the friend and acted as if the comment hadn't been made.</p><p>This act angered the wives, especially Christine, who pointed out that if the tables were turned, Kody wouldn't want his wives to engage in a relationship with an individual like that. Instead, he would want them to take a supportive stance and move forward without that person and their negative influence in their lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eventually-three-of-kody-39-s-wives-left-anyway>Eventually, Three Of Kody's Wives Left Anyway</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kody-brown-sister-wives.jpg><p>While Kody's wives have previously left husbands, such as <a href=#>Robyn and her divorce from David Jessop</a>, it wasn't until well into the television series that Kody Brown's wives left him.</p><p>There were many events that led up to the demise of three of the Brown marriages, but it is likely that Kody's lack of effort in defending the women in his life made an impact on the decisions.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kody-brown-sister-wives.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Is Leon Brown Still In Contact With Dad Kody Brown?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Leon Brown has seemingly cut ties with many people who were not supportive of their transition, but what about Kody Brown?</span><p>As Christine, Meri, and Janelle have moved on from their relationships with the Brown patriarch, their new lives have proven to be fruitful and enjoyable. <a href=#>Christine Brown has since remarried and purchased a new home in Utah</a>, while Meri is spending more time at her bed and breakfast, and Janelle is reconnecting with her kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the original three wives went through a bout of heartbreak regarding their separation from Kody, they now find themselves in a better place, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Janelle saying that she is in a more peaceful state without Kody</a>.</p><p>Although the future is unknown for how the Sister Wives series will proceed with the new family dynamic, fans are just as invested as ever in the drama that encircles the once polygamous unit.</p><p>Did Kody's high school friend predict the future of the Brown family with his statement at their class reunion?
