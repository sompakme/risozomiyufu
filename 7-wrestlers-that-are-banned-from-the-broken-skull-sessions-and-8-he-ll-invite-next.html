Austin has turned himself into quite the interviewer, as he has his long-running Stone Cold Podcast and now his own show on the WWE Network that brings back a lot of legends of the WWE, and even got people <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">like The Undertaker</a> to come on out of character and talk about the wrestling business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are plenty of guests Austin could line up and should be inviting, but there are also some former wrestlers who Austin has had real-life feuds and grudges with and banned from coming on the Broken Skull Sessions. Whether bad blood between Austin and them or the fact they work for another company, certain people aren’t getting invited any time soon to the WWE Network show.</p><h2 id=invite-jake-roberts><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Invite: Jake Roberts</span></h2><p>Steve Austin never gives the famous Austin 3:16 promo if he doesn’t defeat <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake Roberts</a> at the King of the Ring. And now that Roberts has turned his life around, it would be a great interview to have with a WWE legend to speak about the ups and downs of his life. The snake and the rattlesnake on the same show would be awesome.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=banned-hulk-hogan><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Banned: Hulk Hogan</span></h2><p>Hulk Hogan and Steve Austin are two of the biggest stars in WWE history, but Austin isn’t going to invite the Hulkster on any time soon. The two never saw eye-to-eye, as the famous Icon vs Icon match between The Rock and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hulk Hogan</a>, was supposed to be Austin vs Hogan, but both refused to lose to each other, and Austin thought he would have to slow down for the older Hogan.</p><h2 id=invite-the-rock><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Invite: The Rock</span></h2><p>The Rock and Stone Cold were the two biggest stars in WWE at one time and they have such mutual respect for each other. The Rock even said he loved Austin after pinning him at WrestleMania 19, and the two remain great friends today. Since Broken Skull Sessions loves to bring back legends, it would be a great interview for these two to relive the days when they were on top.</p><h2 id=banned-ahmed-johnson><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Banned: Ahmed Johnson</span></h2><p>Ahmed Johnson rubbed a lot of people the wrong way during his short career, but he claims Austin was the one who was the meanest to him, as he used racist terms around Johnson. Johnson claims Austin wrote the slur across his rental car, and he always suspected it was Austin who did it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=invite-kurt-angle><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Invite: Kurt Angle</span></h2><p>Kurt Angle and Steve Austin worked so well together when Angle joined the Alliance and the two had some awesome matches as well. Angle has been on Steve Austin’s podcast numerous times, and with Kurt a WWE hall of famer, it’s only a matter of time before the legend gets an invite to the show.</p><h2 id=banned-debra><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Banned: Debra</span></h2><p>Debra and Steve Austin were married for some time, but some physical altercations between them led to some domestic charges against Austin. So, I don’t see the Rattlesnake inviting his former wife to his show any time soon, and it’s not like Debra was that meaningful in WWE, other than getting ‘Puppies’ over with Jerry Lawler.</p><h2 id=invite-brock-lesnar><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Invite: Brock Lesnar</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brock Lesnar</a> has every reason to dislike Austin, as Austin walked out of the WWE when Vince asked him to do the job to Lesnar early in his career. But they have moved past that and even though they still trash talk each other on social media, Austin says there is mutual respect between the two. Lesnar appeared on Austin’s podcast and opened up pretty good to the Rattlesnake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">17 Photos That Ruin Brock Lesnar's Gimmick</a></span></p><h2 id=banned-hardcore-holly><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Banned: Hardcore Holly</span></h2><p>Hardcore Holly always seems to have issues with people, and his with Steve Austin comes from Austin’s apparent ego after he moved to the main event status. Holly was never that guy in WWE, and when Austin ditched his former riding buddy, saying he was too big for him, Holly just never let it go.</p><h2 id=invite-ddp><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Invite: DDP</span></h2><p>During his days in WCW, Diamond Dallas Page was a travel partner of Steve Austin’s and they even shared a house. That would be a great story for Broken Skull Sessions. Also, stories of when Austin was going through some troubled times and DDP helped him out, it earned him a lot of respect for old Stone Cold.</p><h2 id=banned-jim-ross><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Banned: Jim Ross</span></h2><p>Jim Ross and Steve Austin are best friends in the wrestling business, and Jim Ross would be great to be on the Broken Skull Session, except Vince McMahon would easily ban him because Ross is now on AEW television, and he wouldn’t want to give any promotion to the other company in any way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=invite-bret-hart><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Invite: Bret Hart</span></h2><p>Bret Hart and Steve Austin are very connected as it was Bret Hart who helped turn Austin into the face of the company during the double-turn at WrestleMania 10. The two have spoken on podcasts together, such as Edge and Christians, and broke down their famous match together and remain close friends in the business.</p><h2 id=banned-jeff-jarrett><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Banned: Jeff Jarrett</span></h2><p>Jeff Jarrett is another wrestler who has issues with Austin because he refused to work with him. Austin was coming off a feud with the Undertaker and they wanted to put him with Double J. But often it’s sad that Austin disliked Jarrett and his dad from Memphis, or Jarrett’s promo calling Austin 3:16 blasphemous.</p><h2 id=invite-mick-foley><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Invite: Mick Foley</span></h2><p>Does anyone dislike Mick Foley? Is that even possible? Steve Austin should invite the hardcore legend onto Broken Skull Sessions at some point as Foley’s career circled Austin’s pretty well. In fact, it was a Stone Cold Stunner from Austin to the Rock that helped Foley win his first WWE Championship</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=banned-dean-ambrose><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Banned: Dean Ambrose</span></h2><p>Dean Ambrose had a chance with Steve Austin before on his podcast, but he stuck up the joint, being totally uninterested in speaking or opening up. Now with Dean goes as Jon Moxley in AEW, he is definitely banned from making another appearance with Steve Austin on Broken Skull Sessions.</p><h2 id=invite-kevin-nash><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Invite: Kevin Nash</span></h2><p>Despite Kevin Nash leaving WWE for WCW, he and Austin had mutual respect for each other, and in fact, it was probably the best thing to happen to Austin, as he got the main event push. It would be an interesting Broken Skull Sessions to have the two biggest stars in their respective companies talking about the Attitude Era.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Former WCW Stars That Are Banned From WWE (And 7 Vince Surprisingly Loves)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhuZq%2BimsC1uMSrqmasmJbBbq3RnmSbmZ6jsqV5xaumpmWknbJurtGoop6mXai4trjLZqqeq6OevK%2B%2FjJqlnWVoYrWmuMtmoKeumamybrrEsato</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
