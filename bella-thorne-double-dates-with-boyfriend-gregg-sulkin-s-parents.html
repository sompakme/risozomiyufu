The Duff actress gushed about her new boyfriend to <strong>Us Weekly</strong> while attending the Crocs Funway Runway Event in NYC on Tuesday, June 23.</p><p>"He's one of the most amazing people I've ever met. He's so kind, so sweet," Thorne, 17, told <strong>Us</strong>. "He's very caring even when he doesn't need to be," she added. "And I think maybe it’s because he’s raised in such a great way with his British manners."</p><p>Thanks to his family, of course. Recently, Thorne and the Faking It star, 23, even double dated with his parents at a showing of Jurassic World at Hollywood's ArcLight Cinemas. Thorne was upset that the fire alarm went off with 15 minutes left to go, but didn't mind seeing her love be someone else's knight in shining armor for one night.&nbsp;</p><p>"There was this woman in a wheelchair and he sent me and his mom down and [he was] like, 'No, we have to help this woman get out of here.' It was so sweet," she recalled. "It took them, I don't know, 35 minutes to help her get out because you have to take the stairs."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Us</strong> confirmed</a> earlier this month that Thorne and Sulkin's friendship blossomed into romance. According to the now-blonde stunner, the twosome have been friends for six years.</p><p>"We met through Facebook. Well, technically we met through the Disney circle. He was on Wizards of Waverly Place and I was just starting my first show Shake It Up," she explained to <strong>Us</strong> and other reporters. "We're gonna see how it goes over the next few months. We've always been pretty close."</p><p>She also keeps close tabs of his mum! "I FaceTime his mom," she said. "She's in L.A. right now so we're gonna go to brunch and on Sunday we're doing this whole massage day with my mom, [my best friend] Alexa’s mom, and his mom and Gregg. It’s gonna be fun."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnZyhrm7Ax6ipp51dmby2rsueZJ2ZpJrAbsPIrZ9mmp%2Bus7O1xKebZp%2BimrSoedKuo6Shnqh6sa3RnqWtq11nfXKBkW1taA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
