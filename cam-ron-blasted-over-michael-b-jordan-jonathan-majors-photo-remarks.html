In the second image, the men rest their heads on each other, again looking ahead.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The reason I didn’t go see creed,” wrote the “Get ‘Em Girls” rapper in the caption.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-10-at-7.29.06-AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While Killa Cam was not explicit in his reasoning, the comments challenged the rapper’s stance on masculinity due to Jordan and Majors’ friendship being portrayed through the intimate photoshoot. Award-winning songwriter Skillz shared his own post, combatting Cam’ron’s line of thinking.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We are our own worst enemies smh. I tell all my homies I love em…Why? Cuz I do! Sometimes it throws em off but Ion care, Ima keep saying that ish. Tomorrow aint promised. We all getting older man & death is definitley certain. Its already hard enough out here for black men as it is bro,” wrote the battle rapper to begin his lengthy caption.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You cant even show love or accept it without your own trying to make it out to be something else. I [don’t] know Micheal B Jordan but I know losing Chadwick was hard on him….cuz shit it was hard on all of us. We clowned that man before he died not even knowing how sick he really was. Maybe Jonathan came into Mikes life when he needed a friend…a bro. How come men cant have healthy relationships with other men without [their] masculinity or sexuality being questioned? I put up a post last week saying ‘Black men its ok to smile in your pictures’ and got nothing but dudes saying ‘naaah Ion do that ish Skillz’ You [don’t] do what? Smile? You [don’t] see nothing wrong with that? Maaan the times we living in goofy af.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The caption continued, “Yall got it. When you die and ya family [don’t] have one picture of you smiling you got it bruh. Hardest obituary pic ever. You won.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia added to Skillz’s comments writing “My brother missing out cause its an Amazing movie! I’ve watched it five times and I’m not just saying that because we had the theme song in the trailer,” followed by laughing emoji.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Singer Lil Mo pointed out “Heard you. Cuz we losing sooooo many black me. And you never know what anyone is going through so GRACE and mercy should always be extended. With that being said, BUL that’s Hugging Michael just caught a case for domestic violence against the W lady and they bout to cook him. This wild,” referencing Jonathon Majors being <a href=#>arrested last month</a> for allegedly strangling his girlfriend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1469188806.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Released on March 3, 2023, Creed III earned $58.7 million in its <a href=#>opening weekend</a> in North America as well as $41.8 million overseas.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“This is beyond all of our expectations. And we knew that&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>we had something special</a>&nbsp;— we tested the movie, and it tested great, but the public responded so resoundingly to it,” expressed Erik Lomis, MGM’s head of distribution, at the time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Everything went right here, starting with the movie itself. It was just up to us not to break it when they gave it to us, and we didn’t.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch a trailer for Creed III below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5iurr7Op2SbmZOguaK%2Fx2akopuYlrKtecFmoaiqlJa7brbOp5itoJGjeq6tyaiprGWgnby1u4xqaWxsZ2mEd4CPaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
