Keith Davids, the head of the Maritime Extraordinary Fighting Order, said:</p><p>“Our contemplations and petitions to heaven are with the Ernst family. Mike was a remarkable colleague. He was a committed NSW Mariner who applied his gifts and abilities towards a portion of our country’s hardest difficulties, while sacrificially tutoring his teammates…Mike and his family will constantly be important for the NSW family, and he won’t ever be neglected.”</p><p>Ernst enrolled in 2009 and joined his most memorable Extraordinary Fighting unit three years after the fact. Throughout his profession, Ernst procured the Silver Star, the Joint Tribute Decoration (with Battle Gadget), the Naval force and Marine Corps Accomplishment Decoration, and the Worldwide Conflict on Psychological warfare Administration Decoration, among different honors.</p><p>The beautified SEAL was in battle circumstances in three unique battlefields.
