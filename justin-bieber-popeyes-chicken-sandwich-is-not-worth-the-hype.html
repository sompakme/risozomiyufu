The highly coveted sandwich went viral and quickly sold out across the country in just two weeks. Even celebrities were dying to get a taste, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cardi B</strong></a>, who traveled to two Popeyes’ locations on different coasts.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Diplo</strong> </a>revealed that Popeyes had sent him several sandwiches on a private jet because<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wanted to give it a taste test.</a> “Popeye’s heard I wanted to try their sandwich so they sent me some in a jet,” the 40-year-old DJ wrote via Instagram on September 1.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gayle King</strong> </a>called 15 locations in an attempt to try the hot commodity item before finding one that still had the sandwich in stock. “It really lives up to the hype. It’s really good,” the journalist, 64, shared on Instagram on August 26. “It only took me 3 days … but it was worth it.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a> was able to get his hands on a sandwich for his 2-year-old son, Billy. In an Instagram post on August 26, the late-night talk show host, 51, shared one photo of Billy uncertainly taking a bite of the sandwich. In the next photo, his son is wearing a big grin. “Even 2 yr olds can’t resist the #popeyeschickensandwich,” Kimmel captioned the pics.</p><p>On August 27, Popeyes announced via Twitter that the chicken sandwiches would no longer be on the menu but teased their eventual return. “Y’all. We love that you love The Sandwich. Unfortunately, we’re sold out (for now),” the tweet read.</p><p>After a long wait, the fast-food chain revealed that it would be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bringing the sandwiches back permanently </a>on November 3. The announcement simply read, “I’m back,” in a video posted on Twitter on October 28. The post also noted that Popeyes is “open Sunday,” a subtle dig at its competitor Chick-fil-A, which is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">closed for business on Sundays.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqOto6m2r3nBopybnaJivbC8xLKcrGWTnbakt8SnZKyZnpnEqq%2FHZqCsZZ6kwW7DzquroWWknbJutNipnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
