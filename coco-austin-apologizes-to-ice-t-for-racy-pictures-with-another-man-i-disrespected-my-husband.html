"She's made me look and feel like s–t."</p><p>The actor deleted his comments shortly after posting them, but by then, his anger had already gone viral.</p><p>"I say this on Twitter because there's no way to avoid the obvious misconduct of a married [woman]," he wrote. "That's it. Any more questions, ask [my wife] <a href=#>@CoCosWorld</a>."</p><p>Austin, for her part, initially tried to downplay the incident, tweeting: "Woke up to people in a panic about some pics. Please guys, I'm happily married, sometimes fans & friends take silly pics. It's harmless."</p><p>However, she later backtracked and apologized for the photos to both her husband of 11 years — with whom she stars on the E! reality show Ice Loves Coco — and her fans.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Ice is right, the pics I took with this man were in poor taste & I disrespected my husband," she shared. "However the pics were the only thing that happened."</p><p>"I feel so sad. The bottom line is I love Ice & I can understand why he's upset," she added. "There's no excuse for my actions. I'm so sorry baby & to everyone."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp5OkeqLB0q2gp2WRpbytu8aisZ6rXam8brXCnmStZZakv26%2BwJywZqiZmMG2vsSsZLChpJ16orrOrZ%2Beql2irq95yGaboquimsCxscKtnJ1lna56qcHSm5innF1nfXJ%2BkGloa2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
