Not everything you read on the internet is true.”</p><p>Cline stars as Sarah Cameron on the Netflix hit, which debuted in 2019. Following the success of seasons 1 and 2, the streaming platform <a href=#>officially renewed the series</a> for another installment, continuing the adventures of Sarah and her onscreen beau, John B. (<a href=#><strong>Chase Stokes</strong></a>).</p><p>The Knives Out 2 star and Stokes, 29, <a href=#>formed a close friendship</a> in the early days of filming Outer Banks, eventually taking their bond to a romantic level <a href=#>after quarantining together</a> during the coronavirus pandemic. In November 2021, <a href=#>Us Weekly confirmed</a> that the twosome had called it quits.</p><p>“They’ve been trying to work it out for quite some time but decided going their separate ways was best,” a source exclusively revealed at the time. “They both have busy schedules, which made it hard for them to spend a lot of time together. They have no bad feelings toward each other and remain friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Is-Madelyn-Cline-Leaving-Outer-Banks-After-Season-3-She-Says-002.jpg><p>Despite their breakup, the actors proved to still be each other’s biggest fans. Stokes <a href=#>gushed over his ex-girlfriend</a> one month after their split made headlines, exclusively telling Us in December 2021, “She’s one of my favorite people on planet Earth.”</p><p>At the time, the Maryland native <a href=#>played coy about his relationship status</a>, adding, “You know, it’s super awesome to work with somebody that you care about that much, and yeah, I’ll leave it at that.”</p><p>While the duo’s onscreen romance still gives fans butterflies, they’ve seemingly put their real-life relationship behind them. The Beach House actor was recently spotted <a href=#>packing on the PDA with a mystery woman</a> as Cline <a href=#>has fans convinced she’s moved on with <strong>Zack Bia</strong></a> following a few cozy outings. However, the DJ, 25, swiftly shut down dating rumors earlier this month.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We are not dating. <a href=#>We hang out all the time</a>,” Bia said on the “BFFs with Dave Portnoy and Josh Richards” podcast. “I think as someone like herself who is extremely busy and is going to start traveling — she’s on set five months out of the year — she has such a busy schedule and I think I have such a busy schedule. It is one of those things where we really enjoy hanging out and enjoy going to dinner. … We are enjoying it and not even thinking about what it is.”</p><p>Before Bia’s denial, a source told Us that the twosome <a href=#>“haven’t labeled”</a> their connection. “They might seem like an odd match, but she’s someone who can get along with anybody because of how kind she is,” the insider noted. “They’re cute together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSanJWhxq95wqWgp51dlrGlvsSsqp6rXafCrrvRrGSsoJWoeq2xwK%2Bgp59dpMK1sdFmmZqmm6h8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
