On Sunday, April 28, the Vampire Diaries star and the Safe Haven actress, both 24, enjoyed a relaxing day at the beach in Florida, where they showed off their slim, sexy bikini bodies.</p><p>Hough, who split from longtime boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong></a> in March, soaked up the sun in a printed halter-style top and neon-pink side-tie bottoms. Her newly cropped blonde bob was pulled back into a braid, courtesy of pal <strong>Riawna Capri</strong>, owner of the Nine Zero One salon, who joined the Dancing With the Stars alum on the sandy excursion. (At one point during the day, the ladies were spotted braiding each other’s hair as they lounged on a towel.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Dobrev, meanwhile — who is in a long-term relationship with her Vampire Diaries costar <a href=#><strong>Ian Somerhalder</strong></a> — flaunted her toned abs and lean legs in a floral bikini. Her long brown locks hung in loose, beachy waves, and she wore a gold watch and sunglasses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This is not the first time the hot Hollywood pals have <a href=#>hit the beach together</a> in recent weeks. Days after Hough split from American Idol host Seacrest last month, the pair had some fun in the sun in L.A. with Capri, <strong>Morgan Johnson</strong>, and another friend, <strong>Jill</strong>. “Beachin’ with my bitches,” the Rock of Ages actress captioned a sun-filled shot of the group. “#friendsarethebesttherapy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That outing was followed by a trip to Staples Center, where Hough and Dobrev cheered on the Los Angeles Lakers against the Sacramento Kings. It was Hough’s first <a href=#>big public outing</a> since her breakup went public.</p><p>The girls-only bonding sessions seem to be in line with what Hough is looking to get out of life right now. Indeed, a source told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> that Seacrest’s breakneck schedule was largely to blame for the end of their two-year relationship.</p><p>“Dude works all the time,” a friend told <strong>Us</strong> at the time. “He never sleeps. It’s a lifestyle she couldn’t handle anymore. Work always, always came first [for him]. She wants a more low-key life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajrZyerq%2B6xGafqK2XnXqvtc2aZJ2nkqeyt3nSoaawZZ%2Bbs26%2FxLGwZpqZoLavtYybpp2hlah6sLqMoKCrpKNir6atwqFkraqZpXqxtcKtrKudo2J%2FcX2Sa3BtZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
