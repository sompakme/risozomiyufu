This time of year, our hair becomes a hot mess in the humidity. No matter how much <a href=#>hairspray</a> we used in the past, we could never seem to tame our mane — that is, until we discovered a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">magical hair product that finally eliminates frizz</a>.</p><p>Actress <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Sarah Hyland</strong></a> is known for her natural bouncy curls. Earlier this year, the Modern Family alum shared one of her haircare secrets with New York Magazine’s The Strategist: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">In Common Magic Myst Universal Hair Elixir</a>. “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nikki [Lee]</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Riawna [Capri]</a>, who are the founders, do my hair at their salon in LA,” the bride-to-be said. “I’ve been using their line for literal years now. It’s a UV-protecting leave-in conditioner that helps bring out the natural texture of your hair. A lot of the time I just put this in my hair and leave it be. My hair is naturally very, very curly. I don’t really have an oily scalp, and I’d say it’s more on the dry side. But with curls, I have to keep my hair as moisturized as possible. I also barely wash my hair once a week, to be honest. My hair is mostly dirty at all times, but at least it’s hydrated.”</p><p>To learn more about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hyland’s must-have hair product</a>, keep scrolling!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">In Common Magic Myst Universal Hair Elixir</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$18</a> at Amazon!
