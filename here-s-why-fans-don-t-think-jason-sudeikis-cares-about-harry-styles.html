To be fair, the pair had two kids together, and it seemed like they were going to go the distance.</p><p>But then suddenly, they had split, and Olivia was being photographed with Harry, and Jason was moping around and growing more facial hair than fans were used to. But the thing is, fans are pretty sure Jason's not heartbroken at all and in fact, he probably doesn't even care about Harry at all (but maybe it's because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the relationship has already been deemed 'fake'?</a>).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Olivia Wilde Decided To Change Her Name</a></span></p><p>Here's the scoop: back in 2014, Jason Sudeikis worked with a model and actress on his film 'Horrible Bosses 2.' Her name was Keeley Hazell, and she had a somewhat minor role, though it led to other opportunities and an apparent friendship with Jason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, when Jason received his Golden Globe Award, he did so from a very specific virtual call location. In the background was a mantle with some decor atop it. Fans went sleuthing and figured out that Keeley Hazell, who some publications refer to as Sudeikis' long-time friend, had also shared a snapshot of herself with the exact same background.</p><p>So the jury's out on whose house it is, or whether it's either of their permanent abodes, but the fact is that the two were clearly in the same location at some point for them to have shared their background in their respective videos/selfies.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>&nbsp;confirmed that Olivia and Jason had split sometime in 2020, but noted that the couple's official breakup is marked down as "the beginning of 2020," while others say they were together as late as the fall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Either way, the fact is that Jason's probably been in touch with Keeley for a long time, fans speculate, so it's possible he's been being comforted by her for some time already. Now that the two are apparently being photographed together and possibly stepping out as a couple, fans are digging more into their history.</p><p>And they're assuming that even though Olivia may have ditched Jason for Harry, her ex really isn't that sad over her leaving in the first place.</p><p>Then again, who could really outdo Harry Styles, right? But, at least Jason has an equally photogenic potential partner lined up... If the two ever confirm their apparently budding romance.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Styles/Olivia Wilde + 9 Other Celeb Couples Who Got Together In 2021</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqufo3q0wcOeoKSho2KxsLHSp6tmm5Gnsm6twaisrWWYlr%2BzxYysq7Kklah6sLjIr6CaZaeeuaWxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
