If you’ve ever (over)eaten a big bowl of pasta, only to feel sleepy and lethargic a few minutes later, that’s known as a good old food coma. A blood sugar spike and subsequent crash can do that to you! Foods high in simple carbohydrates — think pizza, pasta, rice, sweet treats and sugary beverages — can raise levels of the amino acid tryptophan (yes, the same one in turkey) in your blood, which increases the level of serotonin in your brain."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A blood sugar spike and subsequent crash can do that to you! Foods high in simple carbohydrates — think pizza, pasta, rice, sweet treats and sugary beverages — can raise levels of the amino acid tryptophan (yes, the same one in turkey) in your blood, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">which increases</a> the level of serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is linked to sleep, so it only makes sense you feel ready for a nap!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This carb-blocking supplement</a> is designed to dampen the blow, so to speak, of starches, delaying the digestion of these carbs while helping to better metabolize proteins and fats. Instead of feeling tired after a meal, you should be left energized! Each capsule contains white <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">kidney bean extract</a>, chromium and calcium, said to reduce digestion and absorption of carbs.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Natrol Carb Intercept with Phase 2</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20</a> at Amazon!&nbsp;</strong><strong>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>Chromium is a mineral that enhances the effects of insulin, making it an all-star ingredient for regulating blood sugar. Calcium is a bonus mineral in this formula, adding stronger bones to the mix of benefits. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">carb blocker</a> contains no artificial sweeteners, flavors, GMOs, preservatives or synthetic dyes, just all-natural ingredients that can improve your health in more ways than one. With this supplement, you can feel great about what’s going into your body!</p><p>Two capsules before a carb-heavy meal is all it takes <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">to kickstart</a> the process. When combined with a healthy diet and exercise, this formula is also said to help with weight management. Summer’s just around the corner and we all want to look and feel our best, so count Us in! Over 2,000 people bought this supplement last month alone.</p><p>Reviewers love how the product helps with bloating, weight loss and curbing appetite without side effects or stimulants. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one reviewer</a>, this supplement is a “no bull ‘must’ supplement if you struggle with your weight.”</p><p>“Listen people, this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">does more</a> than just help burn carbs,” she explained, “this helps your body burn calories much more efficiently if you maintain a healthy diet and also want a little leeway from time to time. Within 2 weeks, those pesky 3 lbs melted away and didn’t come back until I ran out of my white kidney bean extract. Then poof, my 3 lbs came back within 2 weeks. So, I bought more white kidney bean, then poof, it came off again. THIS STUFF WORKS, PERIOD!!”</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Natrol Carb Intercept with Phase 2</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20</a> at Amazon!&nbsp;</strong><strong>Please note, prices are accur</strong><strong>ate at the date of publica</strong><strong>tion but are subject to change.</strong></p><p><strong>Not what you’re looking for?
