This is a word Doctor Who fans are very familiar with. In an attempt to refresh and reboot the tales of the runaway Time Lord, regenerations take place every few years, with the Doctor taking on a new face and a new personality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first regeneration, of course, was the transition from William Hartnell into Patrick Troughton in the late sixties, and we have seen numerous actors leave and enter the show since. Since the show was rebooted in 2005, we have seen Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith, and Peter Capaldi join and leave the popular show.&nbsp;And now, as news trickles out about <a href=#>what to expect from Season 13 of Doctor Who</a>, there are rumors that the current incarnation of the intrepid time traveler, Jodie Whittaker, is also about to hand over the keys to the Tardis.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Christopher Eccleston Left Doctor Who (And Why He's Now Returning)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There will be those who will be sad to Jodie leave the show. As the first female actor to step into the shoes of the Doctor, she has done much to reshape our expectations of who the Time Lord should be. Unfortunately, the scripts she has been given to work with have been fairly weak and convoluted, giving some fans reason to claim&nbsp;<a href=#>the show is now a waste of time and space</a>. Her departure will be one tinged with sadness, but it might be that a new incarnation of the Doctor will give the show's writers the incentive to give the show the improvements it needs. Only time will tell.</p><p>Of course, when Jodie does leave, there will be one question on everybody's mind. Who will be taking on the role of the eponymous Time Lord? At the time of writing, there have been no official announcements, although fans are already trying to predict who the next Doctor will be.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Times 'Doctor Who' Writers Played With Our Emotions</a></span></p><h2 id=who-might-be-considered-for-the-role>Who Might Be Considered For The Role?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PRC_178352976.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The news that Jodie Whittaker is leaving Doctor Who is currently a matter of rumor. UK tabloid <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mirror broke the news</a>, citing a BBC insider who reportedly said: "It’s all very hush-hush but it is known on set that Jodie is leaving and they are gearing up for a regeneration. Her departure is top secret but at some point over the coming months, the arrival of the 14th Doctor will need to be filmed. It’s very exciting."</p><p>The BBC hasn't yet confirmed the news, but Jodie's departure makes sense. It has become a trend for actors to leave the show after three seasons, and as this will be the actress's third go-round as the Doctor, the time might be right for Jodie to leave. With rumors circulating about her departure, there is now much speculation about who will take over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The current frontrunner is&nbsp;Michaela Coel&nbsp;with many people placing bets on one UK betting site on this talented actress. While largely known to British audiences for her work on the small screen, her face might be familiar to <a href=#>Star Wars</a> fans, as the acclaimed actress had a small role in The Last Jedi. If she does take on the role of the Doctor, not only will she will be the second actress to take on the part, but she will also be the first person of color to officially regenerate (after a brief glimpse of another) into the Doctor too.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>'The Midnight Sky' Star Tiffany Boone On Black Women In Sci-fi Roles</a></span></p><p>Other actresses rumored for the role include Fleabag showrunner Phoebe Waller-Bridge and The Crown actress Olivia Colman. Like Michaela Coel, both actresses would be perfect for the part of the Doctor, although there is speculation that there might be another gender switch, with another male actor taking on the role instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Star Wars actor John Boyega</a>, who coincidentally starred alongside Jodie Whittaker in Attack The Block, is just one of the actors being rumored for the role. He would certainly be an inspired choice considering his role in that other popular sci-fi franchise, although it might be that he is pipped to the post by Ben Whishaw. The British actor, who is perhaps most well-known for playing Q in the <a href=#>James Bond</a> movies, would fit the role well thanks to his talent for playing characters who are both quirky and eccentric.</p><p>Talented actor Kris Marshall is also a popular choice, as are Idris Elba and Richard Ayoade (pictured above). Outside bets include Benedict Cumberbatch, who could add another iconic Doctor to his resume after his turn as Doctor Strange, and Tom Hardy. We think Hardy is unlikely to take on the role, given his busy Hollywood career, and we also doubt&nbsp;the fan speculation that Jason Statham might take on the role too. He would certainly be&nbsp;an unusual choice,&nbsp; although it would be fun to see him&nbsp;getting into a scuffle with a Dalek!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=doctor-who>Doctor Who?</h2><p>We are unlikely to find out who the next Doctor will be anytime soon. If Jodie Whittaker ls leaving the show this coming season, we will probably hear more when the show returns to the screen, although there is no air date for the new series yet.</p><p>If this is Jodie's final season in the role, let's hope it's a good one. Showrunner Chris Chibnall needs to tie up a lot of loose ends after his reveal that the Doctor has had more regenerations than was previously known, and he needs to end any confusion fans might have about the origins of 'The Timeless Child' before the new Doctor makes his or her appearance.</p><p>Without a time machine of our own, we can make no further speculation about the future of the show, but whatever and whoever happens, here's hoping Jodie Whittaker goes out on a high!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Karen Gillan's Latest Instagram Story Hints Towards Her Participation In New Thor Movie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJukpL9uw8eoZLCgmZi1bq3CraarZaeeua1505qinmWfq7KzecWrpqZlmqSxqrGMsJ%2BirKSWuKa%2BjJqqZqyYmnqqr86noJxlpJ66pnnLqKmdZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
