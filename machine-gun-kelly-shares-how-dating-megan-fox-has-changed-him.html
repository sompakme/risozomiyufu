Additionally, Fox noted that there’s “never an attempt to control” the rapper on her end.</p><p>“He looks to me to avoid his own self-destructive tendencies, and that’s where I’m useful because on his own and left to his own devices, I don’t know how much interest he has in caring for himself,” she explained, joking that “loving him is like being in love with a tsunami or a forest fire.”</p><p>In June, Us Weekly broke the news that<a href=#> Kelly and Fox were officially together</a>.
