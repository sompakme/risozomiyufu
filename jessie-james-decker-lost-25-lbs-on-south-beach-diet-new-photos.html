Since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signing on with the South Beach Diet</a> following the birth of her third baby in March 2018, the singer has lost a whopping 25 pounds! But perhaps even more impressive: She gained plenty of muscle. In photoshoots for the diet, the celebrity spokesperson shows off not just her <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a>, but her majorly toned arms, legs and waist too.</p><p>“I think a lot of women obsess with the word ‘skinny.’ And if that’s your goal, that’s fine,” says Decker. “For me, I feel good being healthy and feeling fit. I <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">prefer to have a little extra meat on my bones</a> and muscle tone so that I have the strength to pick up and play with my kids.” The Kittenish founder, who also designs a boot line for JustFab, adds that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">staying body positive</a> is emotionally important: “I don’t think we should obsess over how skinny we should be because I feel that’s an unhealthy view of how our bodies should be. I think we should focus on feeling strong and healthy and being the best versions of ourselves.”</p><p>For Decker, 31, that feeling comes courtesy of a rigorous fitness regimen. “I really love high intensity, really quick [workouts], and I like heavy weights,” the star told Us in January 2019. “My brother has a fitness program, so my brother trained me a ton, and I work out with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Shawn Booth</strong></a> too.” In fact, the Nashville-based trainer and Bachelor alum also works with her husband, former pro football player <strong>Eric Decker</strong>.</p><p>All that activity requires plenty of nutritious food, which Decker finds with the help of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">South Beach</a> — a plan similar to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity-loved keto diet</a> in its focus on high-protein, low-sugar, low-carb foods. “I never feel deprived on this program and I know I’m fueling my body with tons of good protein and veggies, which has always been key for me,” says the star, who notes she’s back to her wedding day weight of 115 pounds: “I’ve regained my confidence and have the energy I need to maintain this crazy life of mine!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Decker loves that she can take the packaged food on the bus with her on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 tour</a>. “You can do it even when you’re not at home with the frozen meals that come to your house,” she’s told Us of South Beach. “It’s just lots of protein and vegetables.” That said, she’s not afraid to indulge when she wants.
