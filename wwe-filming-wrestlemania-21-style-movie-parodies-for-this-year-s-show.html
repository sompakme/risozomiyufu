According to WrestleVotes (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cultaholic</a>), WWE will be doing that again this year. No word on which movies will be getting the WWE parody treatment, but apparently Sheamus and Drew McIntyre will be among those recreating scenes from famous films.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>WWE Debated Creating A New Title If The Rock Faced Roman Reigns At WrestleMania</a></span></p><p>It seems a little obvious, but McIntyre as Braveheart feels like an absolute must. Triple H and Ric Flair famously got the Braveheart treatment as a part of the nine scenes that were filmed ahead of WrestleMania 21. One of the best alongside Eddie Guerrero and Booker T playing Jules and Vincent from Pulp Fiction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=might-we-see-some-returning-stars>Might We See Some Returning Stars?</h2><p>There's an outside chance a few of the Superstars who were in those original videos return to reprise their roles for this WrestleMania. While Triple H probably won't be Braveheart this time, Kurt Angle recreating the “I'll have what she's having” scene from When Harry Met Sally would be pretty great. The Undertaker as Dirty Harry would also make even more sense now than it did prior to WrestleMania 21.</p><p>Perhaps we might also see Roman Reigns as The Godfather in one of these videos around WrestleMania time. That's if The Tribal Chief can keep his house in order and hold onto those titles between now and then, of course. Before he defends the gold against Cody Rhodes on The Grandest Stage of Them All, <a href=#>Reigns will need to get past Sami Zayn at Elimination Chamber</a>, and in Zayn's hometown, no less.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>TheSportster Podcast has returned!
