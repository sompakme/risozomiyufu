Michael performs his late dad <strong>James</strong>'s signature role, as the young Tony Soprano - a disillusioned New Jersey mobster with a complicated family life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Roles That Defined James Gandolfini's Career</a></span></p><p>It was an emotional time for Michael and a big opportunity. Taking on his father's iconic character was a tremendous task, and the young actor auditioned hard to be given a chance at the part, and expressed his gratitude to the movie's producers for allowing him to "say hello and goodbye again" to his dad.</p><p>But Michael isn't the only child of James Gandolfini. Let's find out about Michael's much younger sister Liliana.</p><h2 id=what-39-s-the-family-backstory><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>What's The Family Backstory?</span></h2><p>Michael is the son of James and his first wife, Marcy Wudarski. The pair wed back in 1999 and James arrived the same year, but it wasn't long before the couple split after just three years of marriage in 2002.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several years later in 2008, James started dating Deborah Lin, a former model and actress. On October 10th 2012, their daughter, Liliana, was born. James was delighted to have found happiness again, but the joy was tragically short-lived for the couple. The Sopranos actor died suddenly in June 2013 during a vacation in Rome from a heart attack. He was only 51 years old.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is James Gandolfini's Son Michael, And What Does He Do?</a></span></p><h2 id=dad-james-was-thrilled-to-be-a-father-again><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Dad James Was Thrilled To Be A Father Again</span></h2><p>Son Michael often speaks fondly of dad James, and of what a great father he was. In fact, the actor regularly posts throwback snaps of them together on his Instagram, and recalls memories together frequently during interviews. James doted on his children, and was delighted to be a dad twice over when Liliana arrived in 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his manager Mark Armstrong told USA Today</a>: "I am happy to confirm that James and Deborah Gandolfini are the proud parents of a happy and healthy baby girl," Armstrong says in a statement. "Liliana Ruth Gandolfini was born in Los Angeles on Wednesday, October 10th and weighed 7 lbs., 9 oz. ... James and Deborah are thrilled and all are doing well."</p><h2 id=what-has-her-life-been-like-since-her-father-39-s-death><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Has Her Life Been Like Since Her Father's Death?</span></h2><p>James's death rocked the family considerably, and was an enormous blow to wife Lin; their daughter Liliana was only 9 months old at the time of her father's death, and it seemed a cruel twist of fate for mother and child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since her father's untimely passing, her mother Deborah has kept herself and her daughter out of the public eye. They rarely make public appearances, and generally keep a low profile. They were most recently seen in public in June 2020. According to The Daily Mail, the pair have moved from New York City and now live in Los Angeles. Little other than this is known.</p><h2 id=she-was-left-a-considerable-portion-of-her-father-39-s-will><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Was Left A Considerable Portion Of Her Father's Will</span></h2><p>Liliana was left in a comfortable position by her father, James, who bequeathed her a considerable portion of his estate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The papers said that 20% of his fortune was to be left to his daughter</a>, Liliana Ruth Gandolfini. In addition to this, 'a testamentary trust was to be established to hold a house and land located in Italy', with Liliana and her brother given a 50% stake each when they both turn 25. The will also states that it was dad James's "hope and desire that they will continue to own said property and keep it in our family for as long as possible." The location of the house and land is unknown.</p><h2 id=liliana-has-appeared-at-sopranos-events><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Liliana Has Appeared At Sopranos Events</span></h2><p>Liliana does make the ocassional public appearance. She sometimes attends events related to her father's work, and receives lots of praise for attending. Back in 2019, Liliana was photographed at Sopranos Con and delighted fans. On the event's Instagram page, organisers said: 'Words cannot express how humbled we are to have the support of the Gandolfini family.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-liliana-39-s-future-hold><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Does Liliana's Future Hold?</span></h2><p>So little is known about Liliana that it is difficult to say what is on the cards for her future. With her mother keeping her safe and away from press intrusion, and a good inheritance, it seems there is lots to look forward to after a difficult start caused by her father's early death.</p><p>Just like her elder brother Michael, its possible that little Liliana may follow in her famous father's footsteps and entering into the acting world at some point. She'll certainly have a lot of support, and be able to learn so much from her brother and mother about the tough but exciting world of performing on screen. Perhaps we will be seeing and hearing a lot more from the young Gandolfini as she grows up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Where Are 'The Sopranos' Star James Gandolfini's Kids Today?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopuYlrKtecaapZ2nnJu2r7WMoZisZZyewbW4xGaqoqukmr9uw8eoZKKrXaG2rbXAp5hmn5GjsbC4xaKlomWalrqmv4ygmKecn6GzqrrIZquhnV2ovLG%2BwKemrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
