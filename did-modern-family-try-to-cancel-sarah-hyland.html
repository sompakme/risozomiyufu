She got little camera time, nor was she too pleased with the direction of her character during the last episode. Hyland made it known that she wasn't happy - some fans have theories that the show might've tried to cancel her during the last season, given how we didn't see much of her. Let's explore what went down.</p><h2 id=despite-the-hiccup-hyland-loved-her-time-on-the-show>Despite The Hiccup, Hyland Loved Her Time On The Show</h2><p>Although she wasn't exactly thrilled with the way things ended, Hyland kept a close relationship with the cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She shared an emotional post just prior to the finale, showing that she really held no ill-will despite how things played out on-screen, "<span title=Edited>Don’t cry because it’s over. Smile because it happened. To put it in Bachelor terms, I’ve had an incredible journey with this show. Our cast and crew were always phenomenal and we very quickly grew to be a real-life #modernfamily I will miss these people tremendously but am so grateful I was lucky enough to work with them. So get your tissues ready...Thank you all for being there every step of the way.

She recently posted a tribute to her TV mom, Julie Bowen. She also celebrated the milestone when the show hit one year that it went off the air. Clearly, despite the controversy, Hyland looks at her time on the show quite fondly. She's now starting to branch out into different gigs, however, at first, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she really didn't want to know anything</a>, "The thing as an actor, is it’s like, ‘Will I have a job tomorrow?'” she said in the interview. “With Modern Family ending, it’s like, ‘Oh, great. I’m never going to work again. I’m going to have to sell everything and live out of a shoebox.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She remembers her time on the show fondly, however, that wasn't the case while shooting the last season.</p><h2 id=incomplete-send-off>Incomplete Send-Off</h2><p>During the final season, Hyland's spots were few and far between.

That would have been a really cool thing to see, especially from someone like Haley.&nbsp;I wanted Haley to own her badassery in the fashion world—becoming a badass stylist or brand mogul or anything like that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the send-off she did not envision, Hyland stated with Us Magazine that her growth on the show was something she was very proud of, ''She’s grown.

But I’m really happy with the way that she has grown, and there have been some situations where she has been forced to grow even more so.
