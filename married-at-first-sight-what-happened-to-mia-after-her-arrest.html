Instead of seeing who can make it to the end and eventually get married, this show sees strangers getting married at the beginning and then seeing if they want to stay together or get a divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couples are paired together with the help of relationship experts, and when the experts get it right, they really get it right. There have been some couples who seemed destined to be with one another. However, on the other end of the spectrum are the couples that seem to have no business being anywhere near each other. It's a gamble for everyone on the show, but when it pays off, a contestant winds up being introduced to the person that they were meant to share their life with.</p><p>During the show's time on the small screen, there have been a number of infamous contestants who have made headlines for all the wrong reasons.

They tried their best to make things work, but unfortunately, nothing that they did was enough to make things solid in the long run.</p><p>After deciding to split up, the duo underwent divorce proceedings, and everything was finalized back in 2018.</p><p>Per InStyle, "The petition for the divorce read 'The marriage has become insupportable due to discord or conflict of personalities that destroys the legitimate ends of the marital relationship and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has been several years since the fallout between Mia and Tristan took place, and many people are wondering what the reality star is up to these days.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Married At First Sight’: The Only Couple From Season 13 Who Are Still Together</a></span></p><h2 id=mia-has-started-a-family>Mia Has Started A Family</h2><p>So, what in the world has Mia Bally been up to since her time on the show?
