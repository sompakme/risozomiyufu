The world definitely knew she was single, but she definitely didn't seem ready to mingle. In fact, a few weeks after their breakup, it was revealed that<a href=#> Saweetie and Quavo were spending time together </a>and trying to work out their differences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyond that, not much was mentioned about Saweetie's personal life. The focus has very much been on her career, and a few days ago, she jet-setted off to New York to prepare for her appearance on <a href=#><strong>Saturday Night Live.</strong></a></p><p>Saweetie's performance on SNL was astounding, and came with rave reviews. Fans presumed she was departing New York immediately after the show, but as it turns out, she was mixing business and pleasure by extending her stay.</p><p>It seems the hip hop artist has captured the attention, and quite possibly the heart of another man already. She was spotted with Lil Baby, and eyebrows have already started to raise.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>Saweetie Is Baffled After Spotting Robots On The Road</a></span></p><h2 id=a-truly-epic-shopping-spree>A Truly Epic Shopping Spree</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Saweetie wasn't just photographed hanging out with Lil Baby in New York, she also happened to be the very lucky recipient of what can only be described as being a shopping spree of epic proportions.</p><p>The two were seen in a Chanel store, and they definitely weren't just window shopping. What they did do, however, is start a whole lot of dating rumors, and that's due to the fact that Lil Baby showed absolutely no hesitation when it came to spoiling Saweetie. Not only did her buy her a few items from the store, he also happened to drop a staggering $100,000 on that shopping spree.</p><p>In spite of the fact that there wasn't any PDA for fans to lap up, the two looked to be comfortable with one another. The $100,000 price tag for this shopping excursion suggests there is far more between these two than simply friendship.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Camila Cabello Dyes Hair Green After Her Shocking Breakup With Shawn Mendes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmq%2BVmsGqsYysp6ispJqxbrjIpWSbmZKuenJ8j6RkrquUYrCprc2eo2armKS9sbXNoGSsqKKasm6wwK2gp59dp8Kuu9GsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
