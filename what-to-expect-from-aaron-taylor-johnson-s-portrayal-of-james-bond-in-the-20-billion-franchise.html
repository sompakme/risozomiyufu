Although people would have <a href=#>enjoyed seeing many different actors play James Bond</a>, there was no doubt that Taylor-Johnson had the talent and physical strength necessary to portray this famous secret agent.</p><p>After years of speculation about who could play 007 next, Aaron Taylor-Johnson's casting news brought up several questions, including <strong>what his portrayal of the famous secret agent will be like in the $20 billion-dollar franchise</strong>.

At the time of this writing, there are <strong>no plot or character details about the next James Bond movie</strong>. However, some educated guesses can be made based on the actor's career, along with what an important person directly involved with the Bond franchise has said.</p><p>First of all, there's no doubt that Taylor-Johnson will <strong>get into amazing shape and train for the role</strong>. Considering his <a href=#>fitness level and training for his past movies</a>, his portrayal of James Bond could be even more physical than past actors'. He could <strong>perform his own stunts </strong>and might even do more than previous actors did. He is so committed to his roles that he even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hurt himself during a stunt for Bullet Train</a>, according to Indiewire.com.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aaron-taylor-johnson-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also interesting to note that the <strong>new James Bond movie will likely be completely unique </strong>and a new direction for the franchise.

Daniel Craig's Bond was more serious than previous actors, and Pierce Brosnan's portrayal in 2002's Die Another Day was fairly silly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aaron-taylor-johnson-bullet-train.jpg><p>After watching Taylor-Johnson play an aspiring superhero in Kick-A** and Pietro Maximoff in Avengers: Age of Ultron, it seems impossible not to expect him to play Bond as someone who will win any fight.</p><p>What Was The Worldwide Box Office Gross Of The Last Few James Bond Movies?

Since James Bond is already a billion-dollar franchise, that's pretty incredible to imagine. In December 2012, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Skyfall grossed more than $1 billion</a>, which was a record for the franchise. While the most recent two Bond films made less than that, they still brought in hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>Given how excited fans are about Taylor-Johnson playing Bond and how curious people are about what his portrayal will be like, it's hard not to imagine people going to the movie theater in droves. Fans have also had to wait a long time for the next Bond movie since No Time To Die came out in 2021 and, according to The Guardian, <strong>the 26th Bond movie could be released in 2025</strong>. That anticipation will likely drive people to see the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Movie Franchises Make The Most Money?</a></p></th><th scope=col><p>Box Office Gross (According to CNBC)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>#1: Marvel Cinematic Universe</p></td><td><p>$22.59 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>#2: Star Wars</p></td><td><p>$10.2 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>#3: Harry Potter</p></td><td><p>$9.18 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>#4: James Bond</p></td><td><p>$6.9 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>#5: Spider-Man</p></td><td><p>$6.35 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>#6: X-Men</p></td><td><p>$6.03 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>#7: The Fast and Furious</p></td><td><p>$5.9 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>#8: Middle Earth</p></td><td><p>$5.86 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>#9: DC Extended Universe</p></td><td><p>$5.6 billion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>#10: Jurassic Park</p></td><td><p>$4.99 billion</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor-Johnson is also <strong>a bankable star whose movies make a fortune</strong>.
