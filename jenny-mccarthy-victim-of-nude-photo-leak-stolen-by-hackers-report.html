Racy snapshots of the former View co-host were posted on sites including Reddit and 4chan (the same platforms used in previous nude scandals) on Tuesday, Sept. 23.</p><p>According to reports, McCarthy's selfies appear to have been taken with an unidentified man and prior to her relationship with New Kids on the Block singer Wahlberg, whom she wed late last month.</p><p>Neither McCarthy, 41, nor the Blue Bloods actor have yet to comment on the situation, but actress <a href=#><strong>Meagan Good</strong></a> — whose nude pictures were also leaked online this week — spoke up over the weekend. "I'm definitely in shock," the Think Like a Man star wrote via Instagram on Sunday, Sept. 21. "Saddened for everyone who is experiencing this. But I choose not to give the persons responsible my power."</p><p>Like <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kate Upton</strong></a>, and many more before her, Good's account was hacked over the weekend along with<strong> <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong>, <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong></a>, <strong>Lake Bell</strong>, <strong>Hope Solo</strong>, and <strong>Amber Heard</strong>, who reportedly had a staggering 50 photos revealed to the public.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"(The FBI) will mostly likely catch them, because they're relatively easy to catch and many have already been caught," Philip Lieberman, CEO of Lieberman Software, recently said in a statement, via the <a href=#>Detroit Free Press</a>. (Lieberman's software builds cyber defenses and helps with security issues for the government and other corporations.)</p><p>"There will be a perp walk, because they want to send a message," he continued. "And the celebrities will have their indignant outrage and publicity they could never have paid for."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jxm65wpyYq6yYrnq3tcKtoKZln5t6r8HDnmSpoJ%2BpvG64xJqiZqukpLmmuoybsGagkZi4pr7SZqmeqJ%2BnwW5%2Bj2pra2tpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
