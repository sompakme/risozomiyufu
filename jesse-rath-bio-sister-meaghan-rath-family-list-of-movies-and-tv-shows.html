The movie featured Shia LaBeouf and told the real-life story of Francis Ouimet, a poor immigrant who fell in love with golf at a young age. At that time, golf was a sport reserved for the elite but Ouimet did not allow this to deter him. He overcame poverty, as well as his snobbish opponents to win the prestigious US Open in 1913.
