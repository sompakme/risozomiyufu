I’m thrilled to be marrying you. Proud to live boldly in faith with you. Here we go!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They got married in June 2019, in Montecito, California. The couple wore Armani, and&nbsp;they both thanked Giorgio Armani in their Instagram posts. Pratt wrote, "Yesterday was the best day of our lives! We became husband and wife in front of God, our families and those we love. It was intimate, moving and emotional. We feel so blessed to begin this new chapter of our lives."</p><p>And so they walked down the aisle in their Armani wedding dress and suit, to start a new life together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Best Celebrity Wedding Dresses Of 2019</a></span></p><h2 id=what-does-arnold-think-about-chris>What Does Arnold Think About Chris?</h2><p>Arnold seems to love Chris Pratt. He spoke openly about it on Jimmy Kimmel Live&nbsp;about the impression he got from Pratt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Jimmy congratulated Arnold on the marriage, Schwarzenegger says, "I'm really happy that he's such a great guy. Not only a very talented guy and a great actor and a great star and all this stuff but a very kind man and kind to my daughter, which is the most important thing for me. I was blown away when my daughter was telling me that she was going out with him."</p><p>Although Arnold approved of Pratt, he did feel a little threatened. He added, "I said, 'Do you have to be so competitive? Do you have to have a guy who is taller than me, who is bigger than me, has done bigger movies than me and all this kind of stuff? Makes more money than me... what is going on here?!' so I think that it was really wild to all of a sudden have this guy in the family. But like I said, he's a really nice guy and he's very talented, I get along with him very well."</p><p>And of course, the first thing Chris asked of Arnold was, "Can we work out together?" This definitely goes to show that not only does Katherine and Chris share values, but also Chris and Arnold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Kimmel asked, "Who benches more, you or Chris Pratt?" Schwarzenegger answered, "You know I really don't know because I haven't bench pressed in a while because my shoulders are kind of injured but he's a strong guy and I'm very proud of him."</p><p>Arnold also commented on his Chris moves in the gym, saying that he was specifically impressed with his incline press. He&nbsp;then went on to say that Pratt did ask him for his daughter's hand in marriage "in a very traditional way."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Things We Had No Idea Happened On The Set Of The Terminator Movies</a></span></p><p>Seems like these two have started a beautiful life together.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Ways Star-Lord Chris Pratt Stays In Shape</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp2WZo8CqsMRmo6inm2KutXnCoamiq12lv6LA02aYp5xdlr%2Bvu8udZKybmKyus8bEp5ygn5WnwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
