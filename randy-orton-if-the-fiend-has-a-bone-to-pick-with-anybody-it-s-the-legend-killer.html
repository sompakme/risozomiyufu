But the Legend Killer has his eyes on another opponent. In an interview with Sportskeeda Wrestling’s Riju Dasgupta, Orton explained why he wants to face Bray Wyatt. Here are some highlights:</p><p>“I think the potential would be there for it to be a good feud. The Fiend is a character that’s really hard to figure out because I know, at first, he was supposed to be comparable to the devil and a bad guy through and through, obviously. But times have changed, and I think a lot of people really enjoy the Undertaker-like magic that The Fiend brought to the table.”</p><p>“I got to wrestle Bray at WrestleMania, beat him for the title, so if The Fiend has a bone to pick with anybody, it’s the Legend Killer. that would be very interesting. I, personally, I tend to perform the best with a certain type of character, certain type of WWE superstar, and Bray Wyatt doesn’t really fit that mold. But I think with his ability to tell a story and his ability to portray the characters he’s come up with so well, I think that it’s something that we would have to do in the future. Hopefully The Fiend is around for a long time yet to come, and he’s the new Undertaker, so I don’t see how we’d miss each other if that is the case.”</p><p>Orton: “I thought Bray vs. Cena at WrestleMania, when I heard about it, what they were gonna do cinematically, I thought, ‘Oh, that’s gonna be the s—,’ you know, ‘What is that? That’s not a wrestling match.’ But when I watched it, it was probably my favorite match on the WrestleMania card, other than my own, of course. Cena’s talented, he’s the biggest name since I laced up a pair of boots. He’s been the biggest name almost. But The Fiend can hang. Bray Wyatt, the way that he plays that character, the way that Bray Wyatt has played all these characters, even the Bray Wyatt character, when he had Harper and Erick Rowan and Braun Strowman, the Wyatt Family thing, that was good stuff.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBycGlpZmK%2ForrDsmSoqqSku27DwKerrGWkpHqnrcKeZK2glWKzqrHNnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
