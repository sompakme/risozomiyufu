When I’m around black people I’m made to feel ‘other’ because I’m dark-skinned,” he said. “I’ve had to wrestle with that, with people going, ‘You’re too black.’ Then I come to America and they say, ‘You’re not black enough.'”</p><p>Nearing the end of his response to Jackson’s statement, Kaluuya said, “I resent that I have to prove that I’m black. I don’t know what that is. I’m still processing it.”</p><p>On the subject of the 27-year-old’s&nbsp;next sure-to-be box office giant, Black Panther, which also features black actors from America, Africa and Europe, he described the stacked reel as “an African blockbuster,” and compared it to HBO’s cornerstone, Game of Thrones. As for its director Ryan Coogler, Kaluuya said he’s just a down to Earth guy with a master plan to take over the film industry. “He’s a normal dude, in a Golden State hat and a Tupac t-shirt directing the whole set,” he said. “It’s the most beautiful thing to see.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mut7XDZqKapKWqxqJ50pqkrp2cYrlutsCcoqynnmKvs7XToqqhZZGYwbC%2B0mZrcm1paoFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
