Including revelations in regards to Sansa Stark and Joffrey Baratheon. Whether it's how they've changed from the books or what was left behind, there are many revelations to be had about these characters. If you've missed any of them, don't worry. It was bound to happen on a show with so many characters and plot lines. Luckily for the fans, we're here to help.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Joffrey is no longer on the show due to meeting his demise earlier on, Sansa made it to the very end. Perhaps some of these revelations will help explain the disparity between the two characters. After all, there must be some reason Sansa has survived this long. And a reason why Joffrey didn't at all. So perhaps this article will help fans understand the difference between the two characters.</p><p>Despite their differences, their relationship— though definitely a dysfunctional one— captivated fans from the beginning. It makes sense since Sansa is a popular character that fans root for while Joffrey is the type of character fans love to hate. Therefore, the dynamic between the two characters is inherently an interesting one that fans love to watch. Sansa is now thriving at Winterfell while Joffrey met his demise at his own wedding, to Margaery Tyrell. So of the two of them. you could say Sansa had the better ending, though it certainly took her a long time and a lot of heartache to get there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=both-characters-were-aged-up-for-the-show><span class=item-num>25 </span><span>Both Characters Were Aged Up For The Show</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Joffrey-Baratheon-Game-Of-Thrones-youtube.jpg><p>In the beginning of the show, Sansa and Joffrey are both teenagers. Sansa is 13 and Joffrey is 16. In the books, however, their ages are different. Sansa is 11 and is about to turn 12 while Joffrey is 12 already. Since they're closer in age in the books, their relationship would seem less creepy and dysfunctional. Also, a lot of Joffrey's bad behavior could be explained by his age. It might be something he would grow out of. In the show, however, Joffrey is old enough to know better and therefore it is disappointing when he doesn't.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-relationship-is-more-prominent-on-the-show-than-in-the-books><span class=item-num>24 </span><span>Their Relationship Is More Prominent On The Show Than In The Books</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Joffrey-Baratheon-Sansa-Stark-Game-of-Thrones-pinterest.jpg><p>This all has to do with Joffrey's character in the books vs in the show. In the books, there are certain characters who are "point of view" characters. In other words, we read things from their point of view. Sansa is one of them. Joffrey is not, making him a less prominent character. In the show, however, Joffrey is a constant presence from the beginning of the show until his demise during season four. His character is more prominent in the show, therefore his relationship with Sansa is more prominent. It makes sense.</p><h2 id=sansa-sees-joffrey-as-her-romantic-hero><span class=item-num>23 </span><span>Sansa&nbsp;Sees Joffrey As Her Romantic Hero</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Game-of-Thrones-Esquire.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We know what you're thinking. Romantic hero? Joffrey? That little jerk? Well in Sansa's defense, she was young and naive. Especially in the books, but even in the show, she was quite young. So it makes sense that she believes in romantic heroes and could see Joffrey as one. He kind of looks the part. He's handsome. Though his mood swings are less attractive. More on that later. Sansa is a character that many fans had trouble with in the first few seasons, and this is part of why. She was so naive that many fans couldn't believe it, but you have to remember she lived a very sheltered life at Winterfell.</p><h2 id=joffrey-courts-her-while-they-re-on-the-way-to-king-s-landing><span class=item-num>22 </span><span>Joffrey Courts Her While They're On The Way To King's Landing</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Joffrey-Baratheon-Youtube3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This happens in both the books and the show. Of course, Joffrey's courting was probably not the best. Yet Sansa didn't notice. This seems hard to believe for&nbsp;many fans, yet as is mentioned before Sansa has led a very sheltered life at Winterfell. She has not yet, at this point in the story, been exposed to the worst of humanity. So her overlooking Joffrey's many, many flaws can be forgiven. Joffrey, however, cannot be forgiven for being a horrible person. Though he is younger in the books, in the show he is old enough to know better and he should have.</p><h2 id=sansa-lies-to-help-joffrey><span class=item-num>21 </span><span>Sansa Lies To Help Joffrey</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Joffrey-Baratheon-Game-of-Thrones-Youtube2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every Game of Thrones fan probably remembers this scene. It was pretty nice seeing the horrible Joffrey finally pay for his less than stellar behavior. Joffrey and Sansa run into Arya, who is practicing sword-fighting with the butcher's son, Mycah. Joffrey is upset that Mycah is fighting with a girl of noble blood, even though Arya clearly views Mycah as a friend and is having fun with their play fighting. Joffrey hurts Mycah and Arya, of course, defends her friend. Joffrey then threatens Arya with his sword, which is when Nymeria gets involved. When asked about the situation later, Sansa lies and says that it happened too fast for her to know whether the attack was unprovoked or not.</p><h2 id=sansa-still-wants-to-marry-joffrey-after-his-mood-swings><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Sansa Still Wants To Marry Joffrey After His Mood Swings</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Game-of-Thrones-SwayTheBlogdotcom.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even after all that, Sansa still wants to marry Joffrey. We guess she still sees him as a romantic hero and herself as a romantic heroine. Though she can be forgiven for such naivety, Joffrey is still a horrible person. Which is one reason why many fans found it hard to connect with Sansa in the earlier seasons of the show. Joffrey's terribleness seems so obvious to us as viewers that we can't believe Sansa can't see it. We have to remember, though, that Sansa is not only young and naive, but Joffrey is clearly manipulating her to some degree.</p><h2 id=sansa-sells-ned-out-to-stay-in-joffrey-s-good-graces><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Sansa Sells Ned Out To Stay In Joffrey's Good Graces</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Cersei-Lannister-Game-of-Thrones-Fanpop.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This happens in both the books and the show and foils Ned Stark's plan to get his daughters safely out of King's Landing. Such actions are hard to understand for many fans. Ned was only trying to help his daughters only for one of them to betray him like this. We have to remember, though, that Sansa is young and naive. She does not see Joffrey as he truly is, she still views him as a romantic hero and herself as a heroine. She does learn, eventually, who and what Joffrey truly is. It's just sad that she has to go through quite a lot before she does.</p><h2 id=sansa-asks-specifically-asks-joffrey-to-spare-ned><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Sansa Asks&nbsp;Specifically Asks Joffrey To Spare Ned</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Petyr-Baelish-Ned-Stark-Game-of-Thrones-Fanpop.jpg><p>After Ned finds out that Cersei's children, including Joffrey himself, are the result of a relationship with her brother Jaime, and therefore not heirs to the throne at all, he is accused of treason. Of course, he is right about Cersei and her children, but that doesn't stop the Lannisters/Baratheons from accusing Ned of treason anyway, imprisoning him in the process. Sansa, not wanting any harm to come to her father and still seeing Joffrey as this romantic hero, begs for mercy for Ned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joffrey-actually-does-agree-to-spare-ned><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Joffrey Actually Does Agree To Spare Ned</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Joffrey-Baratheon-Game-of-Thrones-Youtube4.jpg><p>And, as always, Sansa believes him. After this, though, she quickly finds out that Joffrey is not to be trusted. But more on that later. For now, all you have to know is this: that Sansa begs for mercy for her father, Ned, and Joffrey agrees to show it. To the audience, it may seem obvious that Joffrey will not show mercy, no matter what he says. But we have to remember that Sansa is still young and naive, only 13 at the beginning of the show.&nbsp;It's a bitter moment when Joffrey rips Sansa's trust away, taking her father's head with it in the process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joffrey-makes-sansa-look-at-her-father-s-head><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Joffrey Makes Sansa Look At Her Father's Head</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Joffrey-Baratheon-Game-of-Thrones-Metrodotcodotuk.jpg><p>This sickening event happens in both the books and the show. Remember how Sansa begged for mercy for her father and Joffrey promised to show it? Well, turns out that the little jerk was lying. He has Ned executed as Sansa watches, helpless to do anything to stop it. To add insult to injury, Joffrey later makes Sansa look at her father's head. Sansa, as you can see, is extremely upset. Joffrey does not seem to show any guilt over what he's doing to Sansa but that is consistent with his character. He's pretty consistently terrible and never seems to feel&nbsp;a modicum of guilt.</p><h2 id=sansa-nearly-slays-joffrey-but-is-stopped-by-sandor-clegane><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Sansa&nbsp;Nearly Slays Joffrey But Is Stopped By Sandor Clegane</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Hound.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After all of that, you can see why Sansa would be upset and angry. In both the books and the show, Sansa considers harming Joffrey after he makes her look at her father's head and we really can't blame her. She is now seeing Joffrey for who and what he is. However, she is stopped by Sandor Clegane, which probably saves her. Imagine what would happen to Sansa if she harmed Joffrey. She would meet her demise in the same way as her father, or at least something similar. So though Joffrey would have deserved it, we're glad she didn't hurt him in this situation.</p><h2 id=sansa-is-able-to-influence-joffrey><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>&nbsp;Sansa Is Able To Influence Joffrey</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Joffrey-Baratheon-Sansa-Stark-Game-of-Thrones-Pinterest2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She convinces Joffrey to spare Ser Dontos Hollard and make him a fool instead of having him eliminated. Sansa does this by playing to her strengths of courtesy and good manners. She also plays to Joffrey's ego by telling him he's clever and that Ser Dontos would make a better fool than a knight. Sansa makes Joffrey feel as if it's his own idea to make Ser Dontos a fool and that's why it works. You've got to appreciate Sansa here. She's gone from being manipulated by Joffrey to manipulating him. And that was all the way back in season two! Pretty impressive character growth, we must say.</p><h2 id=joffrey-loves-tormenting-sansa-for-fun><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Joffrey&nbsp;Loves Tormenting Sansa For Fun</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Joffrey-Baratheon-Game-of-Thrones-CinemaBlend.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the books, a lot of this behavior can be explained away by Joffrey's age. In the show, however, he is old enough to know better and to stop acting like a spoiled child. He especially liked to punish Sansa whenever her brother Robb would win a battle. Definitely not very kingly behavior. Luckily for Sansa, the torment eventually ends. More on that later. Poor Sansa. She didn't deserve such behavior from Joffrey, especially since she's done nothing to harm him despite provocation. The harm has all been on Joffrey's side.</p><h2 id=tyrion-is-the-only-one-who-protects-sansa-from-joffrey><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Tyrion Is The Only One Who Protects Sansa From Joffrey</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Game-of-Thrones-gameofthronesdotfandomdotcom2.jpg><p>Poor Sansa. As is mentioned before, she's done nothing to Joffrey, only to be treated like this. This is probably a turning point for many fans, where they go from thinking of Sansa as this naive little girl who needs to grow up, to feeling bad for her and her pain. It's amazing how Game of Thrones can do that with its characters. Not only do characters develop well but they go through so much to get to where they want to be. And you can't help but empathize with them along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sansa-has-to-act-like-she-loves-joffrey><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Sansa Has To Act Like She Loves Joffrey</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Joffrey-Baratheon-Game-of-Thrones-FanFest.jpg><p>As expected, Sansa has to play the part of the betrothed for the King of the Seven Kingdoms, feigning love for the cruel lion. Forced to say goodbye to the young man who loves nothing more than to torment her, she handles it with grace. Though you can hardly blame her for slipping up a little. It's hard not to feel for Sansa here. Joffrey is always trying to intimidate her and luckily, for Sansa, it doesn't really work. If anything, Sansa is able to intimidate Joffrey a little bit. Joffrey is pretty consistently horrible to Sansa while Sansa never does anything to deserve it. Luckily, Sansa can handle herself at least somewhat around Joffrey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sansa-threatens-joffrey-before-the-battle-of-the-blackwater><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Sansa Threatens Joffrey Before The Battle of the Blackwater</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Joffrey-Baratheon-Sansa-Stark-Game-of-Thrones-Fanpop2.jpg><p>After summoning Sansa to say goodbye to him, Joffrey is not done with her. No, he asks her to kiss his sword, which he has named Hearteater. If that wasn't creepy enough, he tells Sansa that when he returns, he will have eliminated Stannis with it. Sansa then asks if he is fighting in the vanguard, which of course he is not. He then gets angry at his uncle Tyrion Lannister for having a plan to defend the city revolving around keeping Joff away. Joffrey's a real charmer, isn't he? This scene does show, though, that Sansa doesintimidate Joffrey. You can't blame her since Joffrey is always trying to intimidate her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joffrey-s-betrothal-to-sansa-ends-abruptly-after-blackwater><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Joffrey's Betrothal To Sansa Ends Abruptly After Blackwater</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Joffrey-Baratheon-Game-of-Thrones-Hypable.jpg><p>Let's go over what happens during and after the battle. Joffrey leaves the fighting though his uncle Tyrion continues fighting to defend the city. Eventually, reinforcements arrive: a combination of Lannister and Tyrell forces resulting in Stannis' defeat. In recognition of the help they gave to him, Joffrey names Tywin Lannister savior of the city and Hand of the King, taking the position from Tyrion. He also asks the Tyrells what they want and Loras Tyrell says that he wants Joffrey to marry his sister Margaery. Of course, there's a problem. Sansa. Joffrey is already betrothed to her, though he is convinced by his mother to set her aside and marry Margaery instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sansa-saves-face-by-acting-like-the-new-engagement-hurts-her><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sansa Saves Face By Acting Like The New Engagement Hurts Her</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Game-of-Thrones-Fanpop-3.jpg><p>And you can't blame her. Joffrey has done nothing but torment her. She is, therefore, happy to be rid of him. Joffrey, of course, does not even notice Sansa's reaction. He is distracted by his new betrothed, Margaery Tyrell. Getting back to Sansa, her reaction to the news shows two things. First, that she knows that she needs to stay on Joffrey's good side in order to survive. Secondly, that she knows who Joffrey truly is and is no longer fooled by him. Many fans were likely relieved with Sansa when this news was announced, since it means Joffrey can no longer torment her. Or does it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-the-books-joffrey-threatens-to-assault-sansa-after-his-betrothal-to-margaery-is-revealed><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>In The Books, Joffrey Threatens To Assault Sansa After His Betrothal To Margaery Is Revealed</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Joffrey-Baratheon-Game-of-Thrones-Pinterestnumberidk.jpg><p>There is only so much that can be explained away by Joffrey's younger age in the books. Though he is younger in the books, he is still old enough to know better than to threaten Sansa like that. According to Joffrey, a king can have whoever and whatever he wants. That is not truly very kingly behavior. It is, at least, not the behavior of a good king. But Joffrey is anything but a good king. His character never matures in either Game of Thrones or the book series A Song of Ice and Fire.</p><h2 id=sansa-reveals-joffrey-s-true-nature-to-the-tyrells><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sansa Reveals Joffrey's True Nature To The Tyrells</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sansa-Stark-Olenna-Tyrell-Margaery-Tyrell-ScreenRant.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She calls him a "monster" and you can't blame her. His behavior toward Sansa was horrible and definitely very monstrous. Sansa being honest about this, though, shows how she trusts the Tyrells. She trusts them enough to let go of her facade of loving and missing Joffrey and speaking openly with them. It takes a while for Sansa to get to that point, though. She initially tells them all about how he promised to have mercy for her father, Ned, and then instead of showing mercy, eliminated him. Sansa was then forced to look at his head on a spike. She tries to take it back but then is reassured that the Tyrells would never betray her.
