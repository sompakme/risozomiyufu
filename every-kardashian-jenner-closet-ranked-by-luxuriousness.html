Yes, "closets," as in plural.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sheer volume of clothing they each have is overwhelming to the point of exasperating. Between tearing down walls, installing custom accessory displays, and even&nbsp;keeping clothing off-site in a temperature-controlled storage unit,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Kardashian-Jenners have reached a level of the closet game where the only people they can compete with is each other—and it’s a really close race. So, who's winning the Battle of the Birkin Bags?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Million Dollar Smiles: 10 Wealthiest Super Models Of All-Time</a></span></p><h2 id=kylie-jenner>Kylie Jenner</h2><p>Where to begin with the world’s youngest self-made billionaire? Snapchat and Insta followers have been treated to tours of Kylie’s closets, of which she has many.</p><p>Naturally, the youngest sibling houses her elaborate, extensive, and undoubtedly expensive wardrobe in a huge closet. Her beloved heels, however, remain absent. Why? Because her enormous collection of heels have their own closet. Both closets, equally bursting at the seams—pun intended—leave little space for her bevy of bags.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Undeterred by lack of dedicated closet space, refurbishing a room in her house into a custom purse closet was a must for Kylie. Of her many, many options, the <a href=#>makeup</a> mogul’s favorites are among <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her collection of Hermes Birkin Bags.</a> One such bag is a white crocodile Hermes Birkin bag—a version of which holds the world record at auction as the most expensive handbag in the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Luxury Handbags Owned By Hollywood's Most Elite</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-kardashian>Kim Kardashian</h2><p>It’s no surprise this front page-fixture has a huge closet. Aside from all of her own fashion acquisitions, her husband is a designer.&nbsp;As the Yeezy shoe mogul’s wife, Kim has an enviable sneaker collection so huge, she designed a custom closet for her “workout sneakers,” complete with every boot and Boost her husband’s design. While her $60 million Calabasas castle boasts plenty of space, there's simply isn’t enough for the reality star’s clothing collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What is a multi-millionaire to do? Get a temperature-controlled storage space with different sections, including one for her many Met Gala dresses. How does Kim avoid repeating outfits or even remember what glamorous goodies she owns? Using an app to keep track of all of her pieces, which has every item numbered, photographed, and a “login/log out” system to know what is where and when at all times.</p><h2 id=kris-jenner>Kris Jenner</h2><p>If you’re wondering how to store dozens of Birkin Bags, Kris has a 300-square-foot solution for you. Every item has a place and is perfectly organized. In case you weren’t made aware simply by looking around, Kris has a custom neon “Need Money For Birkin” sign.</p><p>Naturally, the Momager has a wall filled with her signature black blazers, as well as a designated section of the closet for outfits she rocks on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. In another “closet” (because, to us regular folks, it’s really a bedroom), Kris houses her extensive shoe selection, as well as drawers filled with designer scarves and workout gear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like her daughters, Kris has a sizable purse closet (not to be confused with the aforementioned Birkin wall). Floor-to-ceiling shelves house everything from clutches to luggage—including custom-made luggage emblazoned with “momager." Pride of place is given to designer Judith Leiber’s creative, gem-encrusted bags, including a new one gifted to her from the designer, herself, during a tour of the Kardashian matriarch’s closet.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Richest Family Dynasties In American History</a></span></p><h2 id=kendall-jenner>Kendall Jenner</h2><p>Of course, Kendall has a truly enviable closet—she’s one of the most sought after and highest-paid supermodels in the game. In a Vogue feature, the fashionista not only showed off her closet but let you take your own tour with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Daydream’s 360-degree technology</a>, so you can get up close and personal with things you’ll either never be able to afford or will never be available to us plebeians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With everything from pink Balenciaga legging boots to itty bitty Louis Vuitton bags, Kendall’s closet is the epitome of closet envy. Make that multiple closets. Not only are multiple rooms dedicated to quelling her fashion fever, but the tour is also only of her Hollywood home. It’s hard to fathom just how much clothing and accessories the model owns because, if this tour is any indication—imagine the sheer volume of outfits she has if you include the custom closets in her various other homes and storage spaces.</p><h2 id=khloe-kardashian>Khloe Kardashian</h2><p>Khloe created an impressive style space in her home by transforming to bedrooms into one gigantic closet. Multiple walls feature floor-to-ceiling storage space for shoes, alone. Island tables in the two bedrooms…err…closets house accessories and jewelry.</p><p>Obsessed with organization, Khloe keeps her jewelry in 4”x6” photo bins and describes drawer organizers as “lifesavers."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Revenge Body host is a fitness fanatic, so naturally, she has a 150-square-foot closet devoted exclusively to workout gear. The enviable—and expansive—collection required the youngest Kardashian to build a custom closet, complete with an LED-lit accessory display for her hair ties. Not kidding.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Times Kris Jenner Worked Her Magic (And Made Millions Using Her Daughters)</a></span></p><h2 id=stormi-webster>Stormi Webster</h2><p>When your mom is a billionaire, your dad is a rap superstar, and the rest of your family is fashionable, wealthy, and generous, of course, you’d have an incredible closet. The one-year-old cutie has already amassed a closet packed with tens of thousands of dollars in footwear, alone.</p><p>Her wardrobe is equally filled with luxury wares, including a custom, diamond coated Cuban link chain featuring a tiny gold lightning bolt from her dad and itty-bitty purses to match her mom's (worth tens of thousands of dollars, mind you).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let’s not forget the gifts! What does one get a little girl who has everything? DJ Khalid recently gifted Stormi her very own red and gold Chanel bag. Kylie shared shots of Stormi’s birthday haul with gifts from top tier designers, including Gucci, Fendi, and Christian Louboutin.</p><h2 id=north-west>North West</h2><p>When your mom is a fashionista and your dad’s a designer, naturally you’re going to wear top-notch threads. The six-year-old’s outfits are always on point, with custom pieces from Fendi, Alexander Wang, and Givenchy. In a SnapChat video, Kim recently reminisced about some of her daughter’s ensembles, including the iconic, custom sequined Saint West bomber jacket and the iconic white Balmain blazer worn in and out of ballet class.</p><p>Accessorizing her ensembles with regular kid stuff makes for an interesting juxtaposition. For Fall Fashion Week in 2017, the eldest Kardashian-West child rocked a black fur jacket and a lollipop and, in 2018, paired a candy necklace and plush unicorn with a hot pink Adidas ensemble.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The current designer duds aside, North (now along with younger sister, Chicago) has a promising fashion-filled future. Remember when Kanye ripped through Kim’s closet on KUWTK? Well, Kim didn’t actually rid herself of her ever-expanding wardrobe. She’s saved in all in storage to give to her daughters.</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Watch Brands</a></p><h2 id=scott-disick>Scott Disick</h2><p>Technically he's not a Kardashian-Jenner, but for all intents and purposes, he may as well be. Scott Disick loves his fashion, too. It may be hard to believe&nbsp;Disick&nbsp;even has a closet—or a home for that matter—because, according to his Instagram, he is always on private jets. Ironically named Talentless, Disick has his own clothing line of hoodies, cargos, and tops.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Disick considers his biggest choice of the day is choosing a wristwatch, and he loves to show off his enviable timepieces on Insta. Rolling in Rolexes, Disick’s collection boasts the Yacht-Master II (valued at $40K), the GMT Master II 16718 ($30k), the Sky Dweller (also valued at $40K), and more—and that’s not including other luxury watch brands like Patek Philippe and Jacob and Co, of which he has many.</p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian>Kourtney Kardashian</h2><p>A few years ago, Kourtney shared a video of her closet clean-out on her app. The notoriously chill Kardashian doesn’t share much of what’s sure to be an expansive clothing collection, but we can see glimpses in her many famous mirror selfies.</p><p>Naturally, the eldest Kardashian also has a wall of shoes, plenty of open door closet space boasting a rainbow array of ensembles, and a center cabinet no doubt filled with jewelry and accessories.</p><p>Not all of Kourt’s clothes are top-of-the-line designers; the eldest Kardashian keeps sentimental items, including a jumpsuit belonging to Kris, pieces from her first clothing line in college, and even her high school prom dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Lavish Parties The Kardashians Ever Had</a></p><h2 id=true-thompson>True Thompson</h2><p>Don’t let her age fool you, this one-year-old has a closet all adult fashionistas would covet. Unlike her many cousins, her wardrobe has not made a public appearance, but, if pics of her on Khloe's Insta are any indication, True is already flexing her fashion game.</p><p>With everything from Gucci t-shirts to Burberry jumpers, Khloe's little girl clearly has more than a few custom pieces.</p><p>At Kris’ annual over-the-top Christmas Eve party, the mother-daughter duo wore custom made matching white ensembles that redefine "extra."</p><p>Bottom line? True has better fashion sense than most—and she can’t even steadily walk through what’s sure to be a huge walk-in closet.</p><p>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Member of The Kardashian Family's Net Worth</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8SvnKuxXaCus7DArJ%2BimZ5it6a6zZ6pZpucpMCmwIyrmKejlZl6o8WMpayxraKevLa%2FzZ6qrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
