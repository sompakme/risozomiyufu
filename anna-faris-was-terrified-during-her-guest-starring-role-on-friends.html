Playing a role in front of a live audience is one extreme for actors, and being alongside a tight cast like the one on Friends was also a different kind of beast for guest-stars. The likes of Jennifer Coolidge even tried to give their own creative output, but realized it was not the type of environment to do so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among the memorable guests along the way included established actor Tom Selleck. He received a strong reaction during his debut, so much so that the cheering needed to be edited behind the scenes. Despite the anticipation and welcoming, Selleck admitted the role was quite an adjustment, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">praised Courteney Cox for making him feel at ease despite the nerves</a>.</p><p>“I was scared to death,” Selleck revealed. “I had done ‘Taxi’ a long time before, but I hadn’t done a sitcom.”</p><p>“Courteney’s a big help,” he said. “That group is just an incredible group of friends. They obviously became friends in life as well as on the show, and it shows. It was a wonderful place to work, and we ended up doing about nine (episodes).”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Sean Penn's Guest-Star Cameo Was Viewed As The Worst In The Show's History By The Friends Director</a></span></p><p>Tom was far from the only actor who felt the nerves, despite such a polished resume.

She entered the mix near the end, and this might've added to her nerves.</p><p>She revealed, “I was really intimidated,” Faris revealed about her first day on the sitcom. “It was also a big thrill to be a part of something so iconic, but mostly I was really terrified. It was a whole new format from anything I’d done and they were all so good at it, they’d been doing it for years. So it was very intimidating and basically terrifying for me.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Bruce Willis Had A Strict Rule About Kissing Jennifer Aniston During His Friends Cameo</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Faris also admitted to being caught in emotional moments with the cast - though she felt as though she should not have been there, similar to how Paul Rudd felt with the main cast.</p><p>“It was funny because they were all in a very emotional, very sentimental place,” she said. “There would be a lot of group hugs, which sometimes I was in and sometimes not. But I always felt like I shouldn't be in them because I hadn't earned it. It really felt like a special time.”</p><p>Playing the role of Erica, Faris was praised for her involvement on the series. She also guessed where her character would be today, years after the adoption took place.</p><h2 id=anna-faris-predicted-where-her-erica-character-on-friends-would-be-today>Anna Faris Predicted Where Her Erica Character On Friends Would Be Today</h2><p>During the same interview, Faris joked that she hardly sees her episode play on television, despite the fact that Friends continues to be a constant. According to Faris, this might be due to the fact that it takes place near the end of the series, episodes the fans want no part of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Erica's future, well Anna Faris has clearly thought this one through.</p><p>“She'd be in Missouri and is maybe an assistant manager at Walmart,” Faris said with a laugh.</p><p>“She may have gained a few pounds and maybe had another baby. I've played a lot of, for lack of a better word ‘stupid’ characters, and there is a weird anal sex joke in there that she doesn't really understand about how people get pregnant. I wish the best for Erica and I hope she's well and happy.”</p><p>Other fans were hoping for something romantic with Joey, but it was not meant to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp6aRYrOivsisZLCZo2LBpr7Rop2inZRisba%2ByKeeZqCVp3qowcSsq2arpJa%2Fs7XNoGSrp5yaerC6jJ%2Bpop2emcBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
