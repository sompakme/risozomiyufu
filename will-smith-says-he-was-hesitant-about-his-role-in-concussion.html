So for me, it was a beautiful screenplay, but it opened up a huge conflict for me.”</p><p>Smith, long known for his diehard support of his hometown Philadelphia Eagles and cheering on his oldest son, Trey, at his high school football games, said that filming the movie opened his eyes to the medical dangers that players subject themselves to when they step on the field.</p><p>“During that time I had never heard about the concussion issue at all,” he said. “It was part of what really inspired me and made me want to do the film, forced me to have to do the film was because as a parent, I had no idea. I had no idea that there was an issue with repetitive trauma in football. It was quite a revelation.”</p><p>Concussion hits theaters on Christmas Day.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6y2rbiMrKSirJhiu6e4jJymp5ulqMCqu81mnaKknWKAenyWbmxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
