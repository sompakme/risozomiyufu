Harrison Ford was born on July 13th, 1942, but began his professional acting career in 1964, starting at the bottom of the barrel on the actor's list. After years of playing minor roles in various Western and comedy television series, Ford finally began landing lead roles in films. To date, Harrison Ford has appeared in at least seventy-eight films, starring alongside actors such as the Star Wars franchise creator, George Lucas, Sean Connery, Dan Aykroyd, playboy Ryan Gosling, Jared Leto, Gary Oldman, William H. Macy, Charles S. Dutton, actress Sean Young, and many other <a href=#>A-list actors in Hollywood.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His continued acting success over the years has earned him a healthy net worth of $300 million, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Celebrity Net Worth.</a> With that money, he has been able to secure a comfortable lifestyle for himself and his family, which includes a garage full of a variety of automobiles. Come and take a peek inside Harrison Ford's extensive garage.</p><h2 id=bmw-f650-gs---8-200>BMW F650 GS - $8,200</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They say when you have more money, there's more problems. But for Harrison Ford, there is only the possibility of more fun. The eighty-year-old continues to prove that age is just a number, as he is set to star in <a href=#>Captain America: New World Order and Thunderbolts in 2024, both being produced by Marvel Studios.</a> Ford's need for speed cannot be limited to one bike, as he also owns a BMW F650 GS, which has a lightning bolt top speed of 105 MPH. The single-cylinder, four-stroke motorcycle is built for offroad terrain, but still possesses the speed to outrun your favorite street bike. The price for one of these beasts is estimated anywhere from $8,200.</p><h2 id=mercedes-benz-sl500---13-200>Mercedes-Benz SL500 - $13,200</h2><p>Harrison Ford has decades of years of acting experience under his belt, which means that many of the cars in his garage would also be a few years old. While he may be eighty years old, he has always been stylish in both his dress code and in the collection of cars he keeps in his garage. Just as he is an actor, the Mercedes-Benz SL 500 is a classic luxury sports vehicle that has only evolved over the years, and Ford owned the black convertible back in the 1990s. <a href=#>Other celebrities who own the Mercedes SL 500 include singer/songwriter Britney Spears</a>, Burt Reynolds, Jude Law, and John Travolta. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Ultimate Specs,</a> this classy car is equipped with a 5.0-liter V8 cylinder engine with a 7-speed shiftable automatic transmission that produces a top speed of 155 MPH and is able to accelerate from 0 to 62 MPH in 6.3 seconds. Surely, there is plenty of adventure in store for Indiana Jones with this vehicle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=triumph-daytona-r1200---15-200>Triumph Daytona R1200 - $15,200</h2><p>If you've been watching Ford's movies for some time now, then you know that he has a penchant for action and adventure. One can only tell by watching his Indiana Jones motorcycle chases to get an understanding of his love for motorcycles. Ford is like the more matured, ever-young-at-heart version of the <a href=#>Mission Impossible poster child, Tom Cruise,</a> who also has a love for motorcycles. It would then make sense that Ford would own his own speed devil - a 1995 Triumph Daytona R1200. It is powered by an in-line four, four-stroke engine with a 6-speed gearbox and 147 HP, making it capable of blinding speeds. But while Ford may be ageing, he still needs to satisfy a need for speed. The estimated price for one of these motorcycles would be $15,200.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mercedes-benz-e-class-wagon---37-300>Mercedes-Benz E-Class Wagon - $37,300</h2><p>In 2002, still in the prime of his career, <a href=#>Ford began dating fellow actress Calista Flockhart,</a> which means that there would now be additions to him and his five children. And so, like any family man would do, he bought a wagon. But not just any wagon - this was a Mercedes-Benz E-Class Wagon, designed for the everyday soccer mom. The spacious vehicle is powered by a 3.2-liter V6 engine with 5-speed automatic transition that can produce 221 horsepower and a top speed of just under 138 MPH. The estimated price for the 2002 Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon ranges between $37,300 and $71,300. Ford can use the wagon to transport large cargo when camping or going for a <a href=#>plane ride with his family in one of his many aircraft.</a></p><h2 id=1966-austin-healey-3000---58-600>1966 Austin Healey 3000 - $58,600</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like most celebrities who get a taste of their first few hundred thousands, there is a tendency to flaunt in the most trendy automobile of that era. For example, the Lamborghini Aventador is a highly popular sports car because of its aesthetics and physical performance, which is why <a href=#>numerous celebrities such as Nicki Minaj,</a>&nbsp;Chris Brown, Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson, Kanye West, Justin Bieber, and television host/actor Jay Leno all have one of their own. The Austin Healey 300 was considered the Lamborghini of the 1960s, so it would make sense that Ford owned one too. The Austin Healey is a British manufactured vintage sports vehicle that was only manufactured between 1959 and 1967. The car carries a 3-liter engine with a 5-speed manual transmission with a top speed of 121 MPH, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Hot Cars.</a> Back in the 1960s, it might've cost him around $3,500, but today, this vintage race car would be worth $58,600.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tesla-model-s---89-000>Tesla Model S - $89,000</h2><p>When we said Harrison Ford keeps his car collection up to date, that wasn't reserved for the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s only. He stays abreast with what is trending and, like most other Hollywood celebrities who are in support of more <a href=#>environmentally friendly transportation options - such as Elon Musk's Tesla Model S </a>- he is also on board with the initiative. The Tesla Model S has been in production since 2012 and became the best-selling electric car globally in 2015 and 2016. With a full charge, the Tesla S can travel for an estimated 405 miles, and can recharge up to 200 miles in as little as fifteen minutes. Not only is it powered by clean energy, but the Tesla has a top speed of 149 MPH and accelerates from 0 to 60 MPH in just 3.1 seconds. It's no wonder, then, why <a href=#>celebrities such as Will Smith</a>, actress Cameron Diaz, and famed director Steven Spielberg all own one of these vehicles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1955-jaguar-xk140---99-300>1955 Jaguar XK140 - $99,300</h2><p>Similar to car manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and Lexus, Jaguar is a luxury vehicle that symbolizes wealth and status, which comes easily if <a href=#>you're a retired Hollywood actor</a> like Harrison Ford. Like the other vintage luxury cars in his garage, the Jaguar XK140 was manufactured for a limited amount of time - between 1954 and 1957 - and was impressive enough for Ford to get his hands on one. The two-seater convertible has a top speed of 125 MPH, powered by a 3.4-liter Inline 6 engine which generates 190 horsepower. This jewel of the Jaguars was popular during the 1960s, and was owned by <a href=#>other celebrities such as renowned actors Frank Sinatra</a> and Steve McQueen. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to CarHP</a>, the 1955 model is worth an estimated $99,300 today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED: <a href=#>Harrison Ford: Treasures Of An Ageless Action Hero</a></p><h2 id=tesla-model-x---121-000>Tesla Model X - $121,000</h2><p>The Tesla Model S was a commercial success when it was released in 2012, but the follow up Tesla Model X was not as promising as there appeared to be some minor issues. Albeit, it was no less popular with the celebrities than its predecessor, with <a href=#>stars like Beyonce and Jay-Z,</a> Jaden Smith, the controversial Travis Scott, and, of course, Harrison Ford, all endorsing Elon Musk's new energy-efficient vehicle. Besides a $16,000 difference in price, the Tesla Model X also differs in design and performance, producing a lesser range of 348 miles per full charge, and maintains the same 3.1 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 60 MPH. The design of the Tesla X features automatic front and Falcon Wing rear doors, giving it a sleek and luxurious look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Indiana Jones And Other Highest-Grossing Films Starring Harrison Ford, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate Specs</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Cars</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CarHP</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8inm6KZnpZ6q7vNnqpmqpmZsrR5wGajqKebYravv8idnGagkae%2Fqr%2FOp2Sfp6KZwG6zwKuYoJ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
