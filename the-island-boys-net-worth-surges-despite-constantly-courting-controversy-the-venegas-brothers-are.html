They saw an opportunity, a blessing in disguise. Yes, they faced widespread criticism, but they were becoming popular, albeit amid a cycle of "negative" fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being booed at their shows</a> and facing a harsh reception from the public, they didn't improve their music at all — and the Island Boys continued along on the path of scandal, feuding with several celebrities, and becoming involved in several serious controversies.</p><p>Let’s examine the early life and myriad scandals of Alex and Franky Venegas, and take a look at how much the Island Boys' net worth is rising — despite their complex relationship with fame.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:09</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/we-thought-you-should-know-about-morgan-wallen_site.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>ICYMI</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>We Thought You Should Know About Morgan Wallen's Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Morgan Wallen's net worth is rising at a rapid clip, thanks to touring, re-releases, and a hotly anticipated album on the horizon.</span><p>Editor’s note: This article contains brief mentions of domestic assault, abuse, or other related topics that could be triggering for some readers and survivors.

They had repeated brushes with the law for burglary, robbery, possession of drugs, and car theft.</p><p>Their mother kicked them out of their home due to their criminal involvement, as well as their poor treatment of her.</p><p>The two young boys, with minimal education and a history of involvement in a string of crimes, chose to enter the bustling realm of social media —as rappers.</p><p>In October 2021, they posted "I Am An Island Boy," and their videos instantly went viral, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspiring an avalanche of memes</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Flysoulja and Kodiyakredd's song, "I Am An Island Boy," was deleted and re-uploaded several times, and each time, it was viewed by millions of viewers, racking up engagement from users as well.</p><p>Nevertheless, there was a massive mountain of criticism, mockery, and dislike in front of the then 20-year-old Island Boys — so they chose instead to leverage that negativity, repeatedly instigating controversies.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:12</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/asap-rocky-net-worth-2024.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Rocky's Road</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>A$AP Rocky's Net Worth Doubled, Thanks To Rihanna And Fatherhood</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>A$AP Rocky's net worth is increasing, and he is laser focused on his family and career while building his fortune.</span><h3 id=the-island-boys-39-feuds-with-celebrities-and-social-media-personalities><strong>The Island Boys' Feuds With Celebrities And Social Media Personalities</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kodiyakredd-wicked-way-ft-flyysoulja-official-music-video-1-9-screenshot.jpg><p>In their career to date, the Island Boys have engaged in high-profile conflicts with several social media influencers and stars — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">such as Adam 22</a>, with whom FlyySoulja <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exchanged heated remarks in June 2022</a>.</p><p>Island Boys have also openly feuded with Bryce Hall, rapper BlueFace, and YouTuber Fousey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But their biggest controversy – which involved the omnipresent and talented social media presences, brothers Logan Paul and Jake Paul – brought them to even broader fame.</p><p>The Island Boys were featured in the 305th episode of Impaulsive podcast, hosted by Logan Paul.</p><p>Initially, everything seemed to be going well; the Island Boys showed off their diamond teeth, and talked about their lives and jewelry:</p><p>But 26 minutes into that episode of Impaulsive, co-host George Janko opted to offer some words of wisdom to the brothers.</p><p>Janko advised the Island Boys to save their money, manage it prudently, and to avoid spending extravagantly — in case, for instance, their musical career didn't take off or work out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Predictably, the Island Boys didn't appreciate this unsolicited bit of advice, and stormed off — but not before starting an altercation with Logan Paul, too.</p><p>Irked, one of the Venegas brothers retorted to Janko:</p><p>I don’t need financial advice when I probably make more money than you.</p><p>After this incident, the Island Boys and the Paul brothers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't resolve their differences</a>, and bitterness clearly remained.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/logan-paul-net-worth-2024.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>No Stranger To Scandal</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Logan Paul's Net Worth: Controversy And Cash</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The details of YouTube troublemaker Logan Paul's net worth are almost as interesting as how he built his fortune.</span><p>Celebrities like <a href=#>Kevin Hart</a> and <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a> have also made fun of the Island Boys, when reviewing the most viral videos of 2021.</p><p>When the Island Boys' viral song "I Am An Island Boy" came up, the famous duo reacted:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Island Boys took courting controversy a step further in pursuit of gaining fame, when they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">started uploading videos featuring them kissing</a> one another, and TMZ reported:</p><p>"In case you missed it, brothers Kodiyakredd and Flyysoulja had fans scratching their heads -- and even shielding their eyes -- after posting a video of them making out, directing folks to check out Redd's OnlyFans page.</p><p>"Flyysoulja tells TMZ ... he's got no sexual feelings for his brother despite the controversial clip, adding [that] this isn't the first time they've done this."</p><p>The more they sought fame, the deeper they plunged into controversies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/snoop-dogg-net-worth.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>ICYMI</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Snoop Dogg's Net Worth Is Also Really High</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Snoop Dogg, a hip-hop icon, seamlessly transitions from gangster rap to global mogul.
