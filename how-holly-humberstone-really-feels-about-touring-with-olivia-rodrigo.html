Holly was just one of the<a href=#> amazing women who were picked to open for Olivia </a>on her "Sour" tour. Olivia Rodrigo fans know that <a href=#>"Sour" revealed a lot about the pop sensation</a>, but the fact it's helping to launch a career is just astounding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Olivia Rodrigo's 'Good 4 U' Sounds So Familiar</a></span></p><p>To be fair, people started to take note of Holly Humberstone in 2020 thanks to her debut hit, "Deep End". It got the Grantham, England-born artist opening for girl in red, a Norwegian indie rocker, as well as Olivia Rodrigo. But thanks to her association with the "Deja Vu" singer, Holly just played her first set at Coachella and is building a dedicated and increasing fanbase. But she's had to work for it. And tours are a lot of work. Here's how Holly really feels about touring with Olivia...</p><h2 id=holly-humberstone-and-olivia-rodrigo-39-s-relationship>Holly Humberstone And Olivia Rodrigo's Relationship</h2><p>Very little is known about Holly's true feelings regarding the pop sensation that's helping her break into the business in a big way. Although it's safe to say that Holly is grateful for the opportunities. She has publically thanked Olivia on a number of occasions during the "Sour" tour. But Holly hasn't really had the chance to speak about her personal relationship with Olivia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In December 2021, Holly posted revealed her tour collaboration with Olivia claiming that she was excited to be doing it, especially with the pop star who she described as "an angel".</p><p>At this point, one couldn't say that the two women are more than colleagues. After all, they don't post photos of each other on Instagram nor are they spotted together by the paparazzi. But that's not to say their touring relationship is bad. In fact, it appears to be quite positive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-holly-humberstone-like-touring>Does Holly Humberstone Like Touring?</h2><p>The success that Holly is experiencing is nothing like her early days in the music industry. When she first got some attention it was during the worst of the pandemic, meaning that she had very little physical interaction with people. During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent interview with Vulture</a>, Holly claimed that it's been totally "different" dealing with her fans and people in the music industry now that she can do it in person.</p><p>But given the incredible amount of attention that she's receiving thanks to Olivia, Coachella, and her increased popularity, Holly is thrilled that people are loving what she has to offer musically.</p><p>"People are so respectful and so down to just listen, and people seem to be rooting for me," Holly said to Vulture before explaining that the touring process has made her quite homesick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I live with my sister at the moment in my flat in London, and my sisters and I are so close. I’ve never spent this much time without seeing them. So [after the tour with Olivia] I’m gonna go back home to my flat, probably. I would love to just go to my local pub," Holly admitted.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo Has Paid Over $1.2 Million For Sampling Taylor Swift And Paramore Songs In ‘Sour’</a></span></p><p>She went on to say her parents have visited her while on tour in North America and it just made her miss home even more. And that includes London, England itself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[Touring] has really made me appreciate London a lot more. I think when you’re in it, you kind of hate it, and get caught up in it. But taking a step away from it, I’m like, 'Oh, I miss rubbish, dirty, gross, London!' I don’t know if it’ll ever feel like home home to me, but I’m learning to appreciate it a lot more."</p><h2 id=was-holly-humberstone-39-s-new-music-inspired-by-touring>Was Holly Humberstone's New Music Inspired By Touring?</h2><p>Holly Humberstone's debut album will be arriving later this year and it seems part of it has been inspired by her tour with Olivia Rodrigo. When asked by Vulture about what fans can expect from the album, Holly said, "There’s been a lot of changes that have gone on in the past sort of few months, so I’m writing about all of that. I’m trying to navigate a lot of these firsts that are going on — growing up and coming out here on tour, being away from family and friends and just being an adult. I don’t really know what it’s gonna be. I think it’s gonna be a fun surprise for me as well."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had a bit of time to write in New York," Holly said in response to being asked about whether or not she'd debut any of her new material while on tour. "So, I’ve got a song that I really love that we did there. I’ve still got a little while to go, but I’m just trying to really enjoy the process."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What To Expect From Olivia Rodrigo's 'Sour' Documentary</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqKScrnqpwcybnKurpKS7pnnOpaCvoZFiv7Cw0aKeqGWkpMKzedGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
