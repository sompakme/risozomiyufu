Before kickoff, Travis’ dad <strong>Ed Kelce</strong> was pictured speaking to Taylor’s dad, <strong>Scott Swift</strong>. Meanwhile, once the game started, Travis’ brother, <strong>Jason Kelce</strong>, and their mom, <strong>Donna Kelce</strong>, watched while sitting just behind Taylor, 34. The star was seen turning around to talk to her boyfriend’s loved ones throughout the night.</p><p>Taylor’s mom, <strong>Andrea Swift</strong>, eyed the game in the same row as the pop star and her pals, <strong>Ice Spice</strong> and <strong>Blake Lively</strong>. Ahead of the game, Taylor was seen embracing Jason, 36, and chatting with his wife, <strong>Kylie Kelce</strong>, with Scott in fan footage shared via <a href=# rel=noopener>X</a>.</p><p>Donna, 71, <a href=#>showed off her support</a> for Travis in a custom Stoney Clover jacket including No. 87 in a heart. Jason donned bright red and yellow overalls with a Chiefs logo over his “Big Yeti” shirt. Kylie, 31, rocked Travis’ “Alright Nah” slogan on a shirt — sticking to her rule of not wearing Chiefs merch as a dedicated Philadelphia Eagles fan.</p><p>Swift <a href=#>arrived at Allegiant Stadium</a> in Las Vegas in a black corset top, black jeans with rhinestone-outlined cutouts and boots, throwing a red jacket from WEAR by <strong>Erin Andrews</strong> over her shoulder. She paired the look with a number 87 necklace in honor of her boyfriend’s jersey number.</p><p>Despite being in the middle of her Eras Tour, Taylor made sure to support her boyfriend in Las Vegas. One day before the matchup, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that the pop star was “doing everything in her power to show up tomorrow for the Super Bowl.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Taylor’s appearance on Sunday marks her 13th NFL game since she and Travis, 34, began dating during summer 2023. She was most recently seen at the AFC Championship last month, when the Chiefs defeated the Baltimore Ravens and earned their spot at the Super Bowl.</p><p>The couple was spotted kissing and mouthing “I love you” to each other on the field after the Chiefs won.</p><p>“It’s another memory in the journey that we get to cherish,” Travis told reporters earlier this month of his postgame celebration with Taylor. “And I’m fortunate that I got all the support I need off the field. And, you know, it gives me a reason to play that much harder on the field.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWRo7FuwNGaraKrXaCyra%2FErGSfmZ2euaqx0maZqKaUYq61eZFpaW1lo6q9pr6Mm6awpF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
