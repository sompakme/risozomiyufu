Stating that she “wanted to leave this earth”, possibly after her trying day of being thrown around in meme after meme since her ex-boyfriend, the singer PartyNextDoor, allegedly let an IG pic fly on his page (which has since been taken down from his page) showing the very familiar tattoo she bears on her hand, being held by&nbsp;his hand…while in bed.</p><p>Where the PartyNextDoor pic insinuates that the former couple was allegedly cuddled up, it caused alarm as Kehlani has recently been romantically linked to the NBA All-Star point guard, <a href=# id=auto-tag_kyrie-irving_1 data-tag=kyrie-irving>Kyrie Irving</a> of the Cleveland Cavaliers. With the wild west factor of the internet in full swing, jokes and pokes at the “love triangle” commenced and Irving was coming out as the punchline to the situation.</p><p>However, with the picture posted on Kehlani’s page in the wee-hours of March 29th , the seriousness and stress of the ordeal is so real that she states: “today I wanted to leave this earth. Being completely selfish for once. Never thought I’d get to such a low point. But.. Don’t believe the blogs you read .. No one was cheated on and I’m not a bad person… Everyone is hurt and everyone is in a place of misunderstanding.. But as of today, I had no single wish to see tomorrow.. But God saved me for a reason…”</p><p>Nothing to laugh at as we hope Kehlani is on the mend and takes time to heal during this trying time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6CyqbjAp6BmqpWrsqK40maqrqGTnrGmecCtq56loKl6dX2Sa29qZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
