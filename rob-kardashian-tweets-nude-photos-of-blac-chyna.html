(Twitter has since removed the nude pics.)</p><p>“Just sad. Loved Chyna as my wife and accepted all the wrong she did and continued to ride for her and remain Loyal to her. Never did I cheat,” he continued. “We had a beautiful baby girl that was the best thing that’s happened to me and soon as that baby was born Chyna was out.”</p><p>“Soon as kylie and tyga broke up Chyna was over the game. She had a baby out of spite and I’ll never view her the same,” he added. “I truly thought Chyna wanted to be a family and that’s why I was so loyal to her but I learned my lesson and everyone else was right.”</p><p>Chyna was previously engaged to the “Rack City” rapper, and the two share son King Cairo, 4. After they split, <b><a href=#>Tyga</a></b> went on to date Kardashian’s younger sister <b><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a></b>.</p><p>When Kardashian’s original accusations were posted on Instagram Wednesday morning, his ex-fiancee hit back in a series of since-deleted Snapchats <a href=#>claiming Dream’s father was physically abusive</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The former couple, who starred on an E! reality show together called<i> Rob & Chyna</i>, got engaged in April 2016 before calling off the engagement in February. They were last seen together at Disneyland celebrating Father’s Day with their daughter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>Us Weekly</i> has reached out to Kardashian’s rep and Chyna’s rep and lawyer for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5JiuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo3q1w8Seq6xlnqqxpnnPoaatp6NivKd5waWYnGWTncavrYywa3JpYGqDcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
