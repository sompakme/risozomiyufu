Since the shooting on Tuesday (Sept. 20), the family had said Scott was reading a book while waiting for his son to be dropped off from school when he was approached by police. Putney also told reporters it was “obvious” that Scott was wielding a weapon during the encounter. “[The video] supports what we’ve heard and the version of the truth that we gave about the circumstances,” he said. “If there’s an encounter [and] you go down and the weapon is right there, it’s kind of obvious a weapon was involved, even though I didn’t visually see it from my angle.”</p><p>Watch the video below.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://static01.nyt.com/video/players/offsite/index.html?videoId=100000004667027</a></p><p><strong>UPDATE: 9/23/16 5:03 p.m.</strong></p><p>MSNBC’s Joy-Ann Reid and others have questioned the presence of a gun at the scene.
