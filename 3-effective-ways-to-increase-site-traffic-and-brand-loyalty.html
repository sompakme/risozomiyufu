This is something I talked in great detail with when I interviewed <a href=# rel=noopener>Brian Dean</a> on my show. He’s a master at creating great content, then focusing the appropriate amount of time and effort on link building to make sure his content continues to work for him months and even years down the road.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>One of the most important things you need to understand is that content doesn’t begin-and-end on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>your </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>site; <span style=text-decoration:underline>it simply begins there.</span></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Content not only needs to be fresh and engaging on your website, but also on&nbsp;other websites and platforms as well — this includes social media and any other outlets that might already have reach to your target audience.</span></p><p>To increase traffic coming to your site from both a viral and social perspective, implement these quick tips into your sites and content marketing plans today.</p><h3><b>Blog </b><b><i>at least </i></b><b>Once a Week</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Blogging at least once a week isn’t a requirement, but it’s a good number to stick with. I recommend staying away from blogging daily, as it will simply be content overload. If you can blog at least once per week, this gives you enough time to create really high-quality content and resource guides, while also giving you enough time and focus to promote your content after it goes live.If you don’t have a staffed writer, consider hiring a freelance writer. On</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>If you aren’t personally the best writer in the world and don’t have a staff writer on your team, consider <a href=# rel=noopener>hiring a freelance writer</a>. Again, it’s not just about creating content — it’s about creating great content, making sure it provides value and is also properly formatted for both SEO and user experience.</span></p><p>The two articles below will help greatly when it comes to article creation, formatting, and concept.</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>How to Write the Perfect Blog Post</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>How to Write an Awesome Blog Post in 5 Steps</a></li></ul><p>It’s also important for you not to just focus on your text content. Bring your content to life with high-quality images, custom infographics, stats, case studies, testimonials, video and more. At the same time, you also want longer content articles than shorter, as this will help with ranking in the search results. If you are blogging weekly, writing a 1,500-2,000+ word article shouldn’t be a problem. Search engines love longer content and people find a lot more value in it and share it more often.</p><p>When writing content for your site, you also have the option of generating revenue from your site visitors as well. If you don’t already have a product&nbsp;or lead gen to offer, you can&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>reference to affiliate marketing</a> or use contextual based advertising (through solutions like&nbsp;<span style=font-weight:400>Pubsio&nbsp;and <a href=# rel=noopener>GoogleAdsense</a>).&nbsp;</span>The great thing about Google Adsense and contextual based advertising networks is that they provide relevant advertisers to your site based off your article content. This not only leads to better advertising and higher click through rates, but also an improved user experience.</p><p>In the screenshot below you can see an example of how contextual advertising could be displayed through your content. You will also see how the advertiser’s content would appear when the link is hovered over. The site owner would earn a commission on each referred click, and the user would then be sent to the advertiser’s site.</p><p style=text-align:center><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-02-at-10.50.06-AM.png alt="Contextual Advertising Example" width=649 height=252 sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><b>Integrate Content Syndication&nbsp;within Your Site</b></h3><p>In the past, if you wanted to get traffic to your site you only had a few options.&nbsp;In short, it usually came down to ranking in Google or paying for traffic. Now with social media and content syndication networks, the game has completely changed. You’ve likely already seen content syndication several times today on your favorite sites, and you’ve probably clicked on them as well.</p><p>You can see an example of this type of marketing in the screenshot below. The most popular sites on the internet are using it today, and not only it is driving massive traffic, it’s also making them a lot of money in the process. The example below can also be seen on most <a href=# rel=noopener>Forbes articles</a>.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Content_Syndication_from_Revcontent.png alt=Content_Syndication_from_Revcontent width=700 height=348 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The way content syndication works is simple. All you need to do is join any of the major networks out there (such as&nbsp;<span style=font-weight:400>MGID or any of these <a href=# rel=noopener>other solutions</a></span>), insert their line of code to your site and you can start serving ads like the ones above. The good news is that it’s pretty much set and forget. Nearly all of them manage the ads on the backend to make sure the best performing ads are being see. Depending on your preference, content ads will appear in exchange for displaying your content on other sites, or for your site to earn revenue.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Nearly all sites are displaying this type of advertising at the bottom of their content, as the user is likely to click off and leave your site anything. This is a perfect way to increase traffic or revenue to your site, without diminishing the user experience. This is the same type of content promotion and advertising that helped <a href=# rel=noopener>ViralNova sell for $100 million</a>!</span></p><p>What’s even better about this method, is that if you have a lead generation campaign or are an advertiser, you can join any of these networks and have your own campaigns displaying across thousands of sites (the same goes for contextual based advertising as well).</p><h3><b>Take Advantage of 2 Billion+ Social Media Users</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>More than likely, you’re already sharing your own content on </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>social media</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. Connecting with your followers is great. In addition to setting up your own personal social media profiles, you should also be creating accounts and fan pages for each of your sites as well. This will allow you to post content through a wide range of social media outlets every time new content goes live on your site, and also bringing high-quality links back to your site as well.</span></p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/social_sharing_buttons.png alt=social_sharing_buttons width=409 height=34 sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Also be sure to include social sharing buttons on your site. I’m always amazed at the number of sites I see with great content, but they make it very hard to share their content. Use a plugin like <a href=# rel=noopener>Floating Social Bar</a> or a free service like <a href=# rel=noopener>AddThis</a>. It’s also important to realize that your social profiles aren’t just profiles — they are <a href=# rel=noopener>actually billboards and advertisements</a> that are working for you 24/7.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Although content marketing can garner you amazing results and insane amounts of traffic, it shouldn’t be the only way you market your business online. Use other advertising methods, such as SEO, infographics, video and side-bar ads in conjunction with these methods. Content marketing is the most powerful form of online marketing, but you’ll gain more followers if you stay visible using all forms of online marketing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunB%2FjJ6dn52Tqba3sYywmLKrXZ67pL7EmqqeZaOewaZ506uYn56ZmHqjvsCnm2akn66urcDYaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
