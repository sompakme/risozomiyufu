There's a purpose behind the theme of culture alive, and it has a lot to do with their connection to the number 3.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quavo, Offset and Takeoff joked about making Versace stock rise in worth and on a serious note, how they're ill-credited for the flow they create. Most importantly, they opened up about the meaning behind&nbsp;Culture&nbsp;III.</p><h2 id=culture-iii-and-tradition>'Culture III' And Tradition</h2><p>When asked why they didn't choose to venture outside of the&nbsp;Culture tradition, the group was quick to answer.</p><p>"Trilogy, you can't go one, two without the three," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quavo said</a> as if the breaking of the said trilogy would make little to no sense, "We'll stop it there because it's the three of us in the moment. You know what I'm saying, it meant so much to us."</p><p>Culture III included hits like "Modern Day," which has already neared half a million views on YouTube in a matter of hours. The music video features jet skis and diamond chains, as the album also features some of the most notable names in rap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Takeoff further told&nbsp;The Shade Room, "There's three of us, that's the perfect number." That trifecta also influenced the album's cover art which Quavo described as a "three-headed monster." Doves and white roses are scattered across the cover. Is that just for looks, or does it hold a symbolic meaning?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look Into Migos’ Quavo And Saweetie’s Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=sticking-together-as-migos>Sticking Together as Migos</h2><p>Offset agreed, "We<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> stick together</a>." Takeoff voiced his frustration that listeners and the music industry counts them out and attempts to separate their talents. According to him, you can't have Migos without all of them.</p><p>Quavo compared their bond to the faces on Mount Rushmore.&nbsp;Their lyrics that have lived on years after release dates speak for themselves, as one of the correspondents pointed out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We know how long we belted "Bad and Boujee" word for word four years ago. Today, we'd still dance to it if a club's DJ decided to throw in a guaranteed crowd-pleaser.</p><p>Fans have waited almost three years, so we hope these songs are just as memorable as Migos' past ones. When it comes to agreeing upon song lyrics, they respect one another in the studio just as much as they do in interviews.</p><p>Sometimes, two of them agree on a vibe and the majority wins. Offset added in that they have to respect the final decision, even if they don't fully support it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardi B Reveals Her Softer Side In A Loving Post Dedicated To Offset</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikop%2BfqHqzsdWemKVlp53GbsDHnrBmrJmpuaawjK2fnqGiYrmiwMSsq2aZnJfCrnnCrqOtraKaeqq1yGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
