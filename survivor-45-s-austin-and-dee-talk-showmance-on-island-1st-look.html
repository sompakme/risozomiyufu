While working together, the pair ended up falling in love. As they made it to the Final 2, Amber <a href=#>ultimately won</a> the million-dollar prize but she also found her husband in the end.

But that doesn’t mean I can’t have a little fun.”</p><p>Earlier this season, Austin and Dee’s fellow tribe member <strong>Kendra McQuarrie</strong> was picking up on the sparks flying between the twosome and saw them as a threat.</p><p>“I’m kind of nervous about the Austin and Dee thing,” Kendra confessed to <strong>Bruce Perrault</strong> and <strong>Julie Alley</strong> during a November episode. “I think they’re secretly in love, which I love. And I want them to get married after.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After sharing her realization — and for making it well known she was coming after Dee in the game — Kendra was voted out and became the third member of the jury.</p><p>Survivor airs on CBS on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKquqqaew7C%2BjG1srGWRqsC1tc1mmKecXZmypnnTmqOkZaOdvLi5wKeanmWfo3qqv8uapZ1lYajBbrjOqKJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
