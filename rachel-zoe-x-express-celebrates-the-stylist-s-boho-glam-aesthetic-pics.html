The world-renowned stylist just launched her debut fashion collection with Express — and the line might just become your spring-summer uniform.
Launching today, the capsule collection epitomizes the style icon’s signature look, which she aptly defines as “glamorous Bohemian.” (After all, the mom of two famously loves a caftan and all things metallic.)
“In doing this collection, it was really about trying to bring a little bit of the Rachel aesthetic into the Express world and breathe some ’70s glamour into it,” Zoe tells Us Weekly’s Stylish exclusively."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Together, the duo conceptualized and executed the line virtually amid the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Zoe says it’s “really hard” to choose a favorite in the collection (though it’s usually “not that difficult,” she admits), but one piece that she’s “completely obsessed with” is the metallic one-shoulder gown that she <a href=# rel=noopener>wore to Coachella</a>. “I can’t wait to wear it again,” she tells Us.</p><p>She’s also crushing on “set dressing,” a trend which she expects to have a major moment this summer. Naturally, there’s plenty to choose from in the Express x Rachel Zoe collection.</p><p>She has a particular affinity for the <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachel Zoe Metallic Puff Sleeve Crop Top</a> ($98) and matching <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachel Zoe High Waisted Metallic Pleated Skirt</a> ($128), the reason being she “really loves a cute little off the shoulder top with a maxi skirt.”</p><p>In keeping with the theme of sets, there’s also the three-piece ivory suit, which looks straight off the red carpet and is “so comfortable and easy to wear,” says Zoe. It also has this style editor’s seal of approval.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While this is Zoe’s first specially designed collection with Express, she’s been the lead style editor of the company’s Community Commerce program since last November.</p><p>So what are you waiting for?
