When asked about the training he did before his match with <a href=#>Kevin Owens</a> at WrestleMania 38, Austin said he did no in-ring training and did a lot of cardio instead.</p><p>“Man, Zero. Zero in-ring training. I was doing cardio,” Steve Austin said. “Here’s an inside tip for you. I love Sheamus. He’s got a great YouTube channel, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celtic Warrior Workouts</a>. I got on there; I watched Edge’s routine. I watched Bryan Danielson’s training routine. But the one that really got me was Becky Lynch’s comeback routine. So I did Becky Lynch’s routine over and over and over again, and then I invented my own out of that. So I was training hard at my house, but I didn’t have a ring.”</p><p>Stone Cold revealed the first time he stepped into the ring was a few days before WrestleMania with Drew Gulak, and after a couple of spots, he was gassed.</p><p>“Once I got to Dallas, I got there three or four days early because I always do. I ran the ropes a lot with Drew Gulak, who’s absolutely wonderful; he’s a great talent,” Steve Austin said. “Super guy, very intuitive in the ring. We did a lot of crisscross stuff locked up, grabbed a headlock, did a couple of spots, and just a little bit of that, and I was gassing.</p><p>“And dude, when I tell you I’m in good shape, I was. But doing cardio at the house as hard as I was working out is not an in-ring activity. And it’s very specific cardio is. So like, when KO comes in or Drew [McIntyre], they’re road warriors; they’ve been on the road. So as much as I worked, it was short notice, but as hard as I worked out, I still wasn’t in the shape because they were doing a specific task.”</p><p>When asked if he was happy with how the match went, Austin said it was what it was and wanted to give the crowd more.</p><p>“It was what it was,” Steve Austin said. “I wanted to give them more, but the whole time, man. When you got that amount of people out there, I’ve been in front of a million crowds, but you’re just trying to pace yourself.</p><p>“When you saw me go sip beers, I wasn’t doing that to advertise my beer. I was doing that to just take a breather and just kind of monitor the system because I was getting a little gassed. And you don’t want to just go out there and just freak out. So I was just taking those opportunities to slow down and catch a breather.”</p><p><a href=#>Steve Austin: I Haven’t Heard Anything About WrestleMania 39 Match</a></p><p>What do you make of Steve Austin’s comments?
