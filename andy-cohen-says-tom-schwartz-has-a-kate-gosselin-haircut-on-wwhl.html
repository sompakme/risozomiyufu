Cohen, 55, compared Schwartz’s spiky ‘do to Gosselin’s signature gelled-up pixie cut on the Tuesday, November 28, episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. 
“You have something of a Kate Gosselin haircut tonight,” Cohen told the Vanderpump Rules star, 41, who started hysterically laughing. “Did you know that? What happened?
