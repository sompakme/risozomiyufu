It's steep praise and perhaps an unfair bar for Omos to try and live up to, but based on the sheer size of the man, the way he stands out next to other WWE talent, and how WWE seems to be pushing him of late, the company must see it too and wants to take advantage of the attraction-like quality Omos has. There may have been no bigger an attraction in wrestling than Andre the Giant.</p><p>While a guest on The Bump, The Undertaker was asked what advice he might give Omos and said, "I'll say this. There will never be another Andre, but this guy is as close as we've come." He added, "That's a big statement, but he's special." Undertaker then said the big thing for him to realize is that he is special and different from everybody else. It will be important for Omos to protect that aspect of himself as he grows and works his way up in WWE.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Undertaker said he's spoken to Omos personally and said they've talked about things he should do and he shouldn't do and let the big man know if things get too heat to call him. It sounds like The Undertaker is looking out for Omos and will go to bat for him in WWE if necessary.</p><h2 id=omos-appreciated-the-kind-words>Omos Appreciated The Kind Words</h2><p>Omos responded to the clip and said, "Man…I’m lost for words… Just grateful… Thank you." It must be nice to know you have such an icon looking after your success and wanting to see you grow into a huge star. It's hard to imagine having a better person in your corner than when it comes to making a name for yourself in WWE and under Vince McMahon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmelo7GmvtOaop6qXZi8rrzAq5ysZZ%2BivLR506hkmqaUp7JuwMeeZKChkaPBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
