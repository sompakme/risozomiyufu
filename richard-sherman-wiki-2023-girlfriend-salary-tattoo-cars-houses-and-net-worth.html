She looks like a lady who's in control, and he looks quite content too. <i>(Image: imgur.com)</i><br><h5>Richard Sherman Wife - Ashley Lillian</h5><td><a rel=nofollow href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imgur.com/NDlRu9x.jpg rel=nofollow width=500 height display: border=0 align=center hspace=10 alt="Picture of his Wife, who goes by the name Ashley Lillian." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></td><br>This picture is from their marriage day. The couple looks gorgeous in white. Our man had a leg injury back then but didn't let that come in the way of his wedding dance. <i>(Image: imgur.com)</i><br>ADVERTISEMENT<p></p><h2>Sherman Tattoo - Does he have one?</h2><br><td><a rel=nofollow href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imgur.com/yDPKPCY.jpg rel=nofollow width=500 height display: border=0 align=center hspace=10 alt="Richard Sherman tattoo, the American number 25 from Compton, California, United States" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></td><br>This picture has so much depth in it. Our reckoning is that he's probably taking a minute to ponder the important questions in life like the purpose of his creation, for example. That too, while playing. <i>(Image: imgur.com)</i><br><td><a rel=nofollow href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imgur.com/YzNmZt4.jpg rel=nofollow width=500 height display: border=0 align=center hspace=10 alt="Richard Sherman tattoo, the American number 25 from Compton, California, United States" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></td><br>We fell off our chairs and rolled on the floor with laughter when we saw the Humble tattoo on his shoulder. He might be, but he doesn't show it very well. <i>(Image: imgur.com)</i><br>ADVERTISEMENT<p></p><br><h2>Family - Get to know them</h2><h5>Brother - Branton<br></h5><td><a rel=nofollow href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imgur.com/RVa9O6D.jpg rel=nofollow width=500 height display: border=0 align=center hspace=10 alt="Picture of Richard Sherman Brother, called Branton" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></td><br>Branton is his older brother and manages all his business interests. He used to play football too, and when it comes to motivating the younger sibling, Branton does a terrific job. <i>(Image: imgur.com)</i><br><h5>Father - Kevin<br></h5><td><a rel=nofollow href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imgur.com/sEV9Hpz.jpg rel=nofollow width=500 height display: border=0 align=center hspace=10 alt="Picture of Richard Sherman Father, called Kevin" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></td><br>Anyone that wears shades inside is automatically cool. Dad's got a lot of swag, by the way. His mum is also in the picture. <i>(Image: imgur.com)</i><h2>Sherman Car - What does he drive?</h2><h5>Tesla</h5><td><a rel=nofollow href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imgur.com/espzY5Y.jpg rel=nofollow width=500 height display: border=0 align=center hspace=10 alt="Picture of his Tesla car" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></td><br>We are extremely disappointed by his choice of cars. Call us petrolheads or any other name you want, but an internal combustion engine is a glorious thing. <i>(Image: imgur.com)</i><h2>House - Where does he live?</h2><h5>Location: Seattle, Washington, United States</h5><td><a rel=nofollow href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imgur.com/2D4TDpE.jpg rel=nofollow width=500 height display: border=0 align=center hspace=10 alt="House of the American number 25, located in Seattle, Washington, United States" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></td><br>He bought Jamal Crawford's Mansion for $2.3 Million when he was playing for the Seahawks. We're not sure if he still owns it. <i>(Image: imgur.com)</i><br><h5>Location: Seattle, Washington, United States</h5><td><a rel=nofollow href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imgur.com/ygPmvsY.jpg rel=nofollow width=500 height display: border=0 align=center hspace=10 alt="House of the American number 25, located in Seattle, Washington, United States" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></td><br>The house has an indoor pool, and it looks really cool. Who doesn't like spending hours on end in the water? <i>(Image: imgur.com)</i><h2>Sherman Salary & Net Worth</h2><h5>SALARY 2022</h5><i>How much does he earn?</i> In March 2018 the cornerback signed a contract with the San Francisco 49ers that nets him a massive salary of <b>9.05 Million Dollars (8.3 Million Euros)</b> per year.

How cool is that? If he has another great season, his next contract extension is going to be massive. The 32-year-old's net worth is about $35 million.<h2>Biography</h2>Touted as a loudmouth by some, this cornerback follows up his words by actions. He's an outgoing personality who has gone on to proclaim himself as the best in his position, a bold claim indeed. Is he what he claims to be is arguably the question on everyone's minds. Fans and haters alike. He's the phrase "Straight Outta Compton" personified. Born in the famous Californian city, he attended Dominguez High School in his area. He was an excellent baller and a top-level track and field athlete in school. The young man later attended the prestigious Stanford University after receiving a scholarship. He started as a WR, but an injury forced him to become a CB, and he thrived in his new role. He was eligible for the 2011 NFL Draft and was picked by the Seattle Seahawks as the 154th overall in Round 5. He had to be one of their best picks because he, along with his teammates, won the Seahawks a Super Bowl in 2014. The 2013 season that led to the Super Bowl was also one of his best in terms of individual performances, and he was the NFL interception leader for that term. After an eventful time in Seattle, he transferred to 49ers in March 2018. Now that he's thirty-two years old, his athleticism and abilities have come under the radar. But he's a smart player that can read the game well and will be an authority figure that leads the youngsters in the SF dressing room.<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uMDFqKatZpOkunC6xaVmqaSRrrKze9GimqGZopl6tLTEq6Sapl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
