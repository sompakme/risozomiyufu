In an exclusive interview with Us, Joel Madden looked back on everything the band has accomplished since he and brother Benji Madden formed Good Charlotte in the ‘90s. “I’m proud that we started as a group of kids in school together when we were 15 and we stayed together for 27 years now,” the “Artist Friendly” podcast host, 44, tells Us while promoting season 15 of Ink Master."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

[It’s] a big mid-tempo ballad, but has a lot of meaning to me.”</p><p>The band’s older music “are the DNA of all the things we do these days,” the musician explains. “It’s [about] finding a way to give people something to take away for themselves, to relate to it in their own way and use it in a positive way for their own life.”</p><p>Madden also points to some of the band’s more recent singles as being personally significant. “There’s a song we have called ‘Last December’ [which holds] a lot of meaning,” he tells Us. “There’s some songs on Generation RX that I really loved, like ‘Actual Pain’ and ‘Shadowboxer.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As Good Charlotte fans wait to hear about new music and a new tour (“Whatever we decide to do, it’ll be special and it’ll feel special to us,” Madden teases), fans can catch the singer hosting <a href=#>the latest chapter</a> of Ink Master. “It’s exciting,” the musician says, noting he believes season 15 of the tattoo-themed competition series is his “favorite season yet.”</p><p>Ink Master returns November 1 on Paramount+</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGonZxiuqKww56lZqqVq7KiuNJmrqGhk516qLvOnWScoJGnubDA055krKeenHqpsYylpq%2Bdo2LBsHnToaCsZZSWxm5%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
