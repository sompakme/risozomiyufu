Oh, wait a minute, isn’t it supposed to be? Well, we know that celebrities are busy with their career and they always have to look polished when they leave home just in case they run into the paparazzi. It can take an entire team just to get them ready for an event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now throw in some children and the stress is on a whole new level. When it comes to celebrities, they need all the help they can get, especially if they have multiple children. Just imagine Angelina Jolie and her six children. It’s not easy getting all those kids packed up and traveling with them. A few of them are older now and that probably helps but there was a time when she had a bunch of little ones running around.</p><p>Some celebrities don’t just have one nanny, they have multiple ones. They are busy reading scripts and traveling from place to place that they may not have the time to walk their kids to school or make them lunches. It’s just the reality of their lifestyle. A household like Jolie’s would require an army we would think especially since it’s well known that there are no rules in that house. We almost feel sorry for the nannies that have to work there. Almost. Check out these 15 celeb moms with more nannies than actual kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zoe-saldana-is-busy-being-a-guardian><strong>Zoe Saldana&nbsp;is busy being a Guardian</strong></h2><p>While Zoe Saldana is busy fighting battles in the galaxy so she had to hire help for her kids. She’s a huge star now, not only with that movie but with movies like Avatar which, rumor has it, will have some sequels coming out. She’s busy and needs some help. She has twin boys and we all know that twins are double the fun. Each of her children has their own separate nanny to look after them. Her children will go to the set with her and while she’s filming, they spend time with the nanny. She has often praised her team in interviews because she knows it’s because of her nannies that she is able to get to work.</p><p><strong>“Our assistant, our nanny, and our housekeeper. They are literally raising our children with us. It’s because of them I am able to rip myself away as long as I can, and my husband as well, to do what we do.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They’re teaching us how to manage our pain as they’re raising our kids with us." Saldana has said however that it’s not easy leaving her children. She has talked about the “pain” of leaving her children that “never goes away.” "When you’re away a little too much, it compromises a lot more things. It’s a sacrifice and a pain that will never go away. You take every day at a time. If something changes in their behaviour, you know how to adjust to it."</p><h2 id=megan-fox-gave-an-ultimatum><strong>Megan Fox Gave An Ultimatum</strong></h2><p>Megan Fox has three kids now with actor Brian Austin Green and when it came time to have children, she insisted on hiring a night nurse as well as a day nanny. It’s funny because before she had any children, she got herself into some hot water for criticizing mothers who hired nannies. “I’m not making six movies a year because I feel obligated if I’m going to have all these kids, I need to actually parent them myself and not hire a staff of people to take care of them for me.” It’s certainly her choice if she wants to hire nannies or not. There are plenty of stars in Hollywood that don’t have any nannies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>When it came time for her to juggle work and children, it wasn’t long before she was hiring herself some nannies too. When her oldest was just two weeks old, she hired a night nurse to come in and help her.</strong></p><p>We have to wonder if that was so that she could get some sleep. She told Greene that they were hiring a nanny or else because she wanted to be able to have quality time with him. If they are traveling the couple usually has two nannies with them.</p><h2 id=britney-spears-always-has-nannies><strong>Britney Spears Always Has Nannies</strong></h2><p>Britney Spears usually has a couple of nannies working for her over the years and it wasn’t surprising to hear that she wasn’t very knowledgeable about parenting. She has been known to hire young nannies that she can relate to and they eventually become her friends. A few of her former nannies started speaking out about Britney and how she is with her kids. “Britney will hold her kids for like 10 minutes and then say, ‘I’m done now. You can take them.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She usually had two nannies working for her at a time for her two boys. One of her nannies spoke to OK! Magazine stating that Spears really loves her children, she just doesn’t know much about parenting. "She is really sweet and loving," her nanny told OK! "She loves her kids, she’s just not very knowledgeable about little things." Her heart is in the right place but she makes mistakes in regard to the skill of a parent. "Britney chews gum all the time and she gives Preston gum all the time," the former nanny said.</p><p><strong>"No one is brushing his teeth, they look horrible, and Britney is worried about how they look and is like, 'Should I bleach them?'</strong></p><p>At one point Britney had stopped breastfeeding one of her sons and thought she could start again. "Two weeks ago, she thought she could start breastfeeding Jayden again."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-and-her-army-of-nannies><strong>Kourtney Kardashian And Her Army of Nannies</strong></h2><p>We can see why Kourtney Kardashian might need some help around the house, we’re not sure how involved Scott is with the kids or how often he comes to help out with them. What’s always fun though is when celebrities go on about what a hands-on mom they are and they are wiping up homemade baby food all the while there is a team of nannies behind them. It’s almost cute. If you ever tune in to Keeping Up With The Kardashians, you will notice that Kourtney has all the time in the world to talk to her sisters or her ex and there is never a child dangling from her leg. That’s because she has a team of nannies with her that allow her to have all the time in the world. She recently went to Japan with her sisters, children-free. She also hangs with her boyfriend a lot without her children. This is all done with the help of a team of nannies. If you look at everything she does in a day including working out, you wonder when she has time to see her children. She definitely does it all, we’re just not sure how often she sees her kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anna-friel-needs-a-lot-of-help><strong>Anna Friel Needs A Lot of Help</strong></h2><p>We know Anna Friel from the Harry Potter franchise and she has actually stated that she owes her career to her two nannies. She only has one child but for some reason, she needs two nannies to take care of her daughter. Friel is a single mother and she has one nanny that comes in to do a day shift and one that comes in at night. She has around-the-clock help and doesn’t even need to be around at all if she doesn’t want to. If she is required to be on a set all day then she’s covered. She doesn’t have to worry about bath time, packing lunch, reading bedtime stories or anything. She told Stylist magazine,</p><p><strong>“Those two ladies are the ones I respect more than anyone I can think of. They have given me everything.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was a time that Friel considered having more children but couldn’t seem to find the time to do so. "It would be awful not to have another child, I'd love two more. But at the moment I've got a busy schedule and it wouldn't be fair on the people I'm committed to if I were to say, 'Sorry, but I'm pregnant.' Being a mum has been the most incredible experience.”</p><h2 id=heidi-klum-takes-a-ton-of-nannies-on-vacation><strong>Heidi Klum Takes A Ton of Nannies on Vacation</strong></h2><p>Heidi Klum is as busy as ever, she’s still an in-demand model and a TV host. She doesn’t have to worry about mommy duties getting in her way, she has a team of nannies that help her with that sort of thing. Even though she is no longer walking the runway she still gets plenty of work when it comes to her own intimate apparel line as well as magazine cover shoots. She has three nannies working for her and they travel with her wherever she needs to be especially when it comes to vacations. She’s a little bit of a hero as well. During a vacation in Hawaii, she actually saved one of her nannies from drowning when she pulled her out of the ocean. A riptide almost drowned the nanny and her son Henry, but Klum was able to save the day with the help of her bodyguard boyfriend. She told Ellen DeGeneres all about the experience when she was on the show. “We were in Hawaii two weeks ago. And we had an awesome holiday until the last day. On the last day, when my son and three grown-ups were in the water and all of&nbsp;a sudden, one of those riptides came and took my son and everyone into the water and they couldn’t get back out. It all happened so fast. It was so scary. I mean it happens in a second.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blac-chyna-is-spoiled><strong>Blac Chyna Is Spoiled</strong></h2><p>Blac Chyna is all about the dramatic lifestyle especially when it comes to her ex Rob Kardashian. Their feuds have often been legendary. She’s a former dancer who now models and she’s always in the media for one drama or another. She has a son, Cairo, and a daughter, Dream, and</p><p><strong>she requires two nannies to take care of her son and a third to take care of her daughter.</strong></p><p>That’s a lot of nannies, but Rob Kardashian doesn’t seem to mind. "Nanny Joy has been around since King was born," Kardashian revealed in the premiere episode. "She's a big help, and she's always there for Chyna." We don’t think that Chyna is doing much mothering. She can go about her day doing whatever she wants without having to be dragged down by motherhood. Currently, she has a beauty salon in Los Angeles and started her own makeup brand in 2014. Apparently, Nanny Joy even gives Chyna some helpful relationship advice. “Every time you guys have an argument — let's say you're arguing at one o' clock in the morning — you're going to throw him out?" she questioned Chyna. "Does that make sense?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mariah-carey-s-kids-make-instagram-appearances><strong>Mariah Carey’s Kids Make Instagram Appearances</strong></h2><p>Mariah Carey has been a diva throughout her whole career so it’s not really surprising to hear that she has a team of nannies helping her out. She works out in heels so she would likely be changing diapers or pushing a stroller in heels as well. Sometimes it seems as if her children are just around for her to get the next Instagram photo. She gets jealous easily when it comes to her nannies though and there seems to be a high turnover rate when it comes to nannies working for the singer. We’re not entirely sure how many she has been she’s always hiring new ones. “Unfortunately, I have two nannies,” she said. “But I’m very hands on. I fire nannies like this (snapping her fingers). If they try to make themselves more important in the baby’s mind than me,” she told the hip-hop radio station Power 105 in an interview. Her nannies are on call all the time, sometimes working 100-hour work weeks. They have to be on call for her 24 hours a day. She states that she’s a very hands-on mom. “I wouldn’t be just like, ‘Oh, I’m having a child, yay! Let me get a nanny so I can give her the baby. Take the kid’,” she said. “That doesn’t work for me, I don’t believe in that.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amy-poehler-is-thankful-for-her-nannies><strong>Amy Poehler Is Thankful For Her Nannies</strong></h2><p>She is another actress that has publicly thanked her nannies for all the hard work that they do and for allowing her to have the career that she does. She wrote in an essay for Elle Magazine, "I’m successful at work, because of my nanny," the comedian and producer wrote. "The only reason I have a career is that we have a wonderful nanny who does everything in our house." She doesn’t just have one nanny, she has two of them, one for each of her children. She once did an SNL spoof video of Taylor Swift’s Bad Blood and it included her nannies as part of her squad. At a dinner honoring Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2011, Poehler once again gave thanks for her nannies. “It is Jackie Johnson from Trinidad and it is Dawa Chodon from Tibet, who come to my house and help me raise my children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>And for you working women who are out there tonight who get to do what you get to do because there are wonderful people who help you at home, I would like to take a moment to thank those people, some of whom are watching their children right now while you’re at this event.</strong></p><p>Those are people who love your children as much as you do, and who inspire them and influence them and on behalf of every sister and mother and person who stands in your kitchen and helps you love your child, I say thank you and I celebrate you tonight.”</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-and-her-luxurious-lifestyle><strong>Kim Kardashian and Her Luxurious Lifestyle</strong></h2><p>Kim Kardashian is all about living the lavish lifestyle and her husband Kanye West is no different. They have a ton of nannies not to mention other staff to help make their lives as easy as possible. It has even been said that Kim has a night nanny to ensure that the couple is not disturbed throughout the night by any of their children. Kim needs to get her full eight hours of sleep. She has to be at the top of her game when it comes to having all those cameras following her around all the time. Kim has three children now and she has a nanny for each one. Her former assistant told Refinery 29&nbsp;that</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Kim also has "a personal assistant, a house assistant, two nannies (prior to Chicago’s birth), a COO, and an executive assistant."</strong></p><p>Pam Behan used to be a nanny for Kris Jenner when Kim was younger. She said not much has changed in the family and Jenner was pretty demanding. “Kris wants what she wants, when she wants it, which is usually now!' " Behan told Daily News. "Especially as hired help, there were good times and bad times." Behan stated that she forgot to buy broccoli at the grocery store and Jenner lost her temper. "I can't believe you forgot the broccoli!" Kris Jenner belted out.</p><h2 id=j-lo-s-kids-have-to-schedule-time-with-her><strong>J.Lo’s Kids Have To Schedule Time With Her</strong></h2><p>We couldn’t even imagine what Jennifer Lopez’s life must be like. She is a full-time musician with an acting career as well. She’s on top making millions and she has a set of twins to look after as well. This girl definitely has her hands full and that’s why she has a team working around the clock for her. J-Lo is so busy that her kids have to schedule in time with her. We aren’t even kidding. They can’t be around her all the time because she’s busy. She has hired nannies to ensure they are well taken care of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“My son said to me this week, he goes, ‘Mom, I'd like to schedule a picnic with you this week because I know you've been, you know, working hard.’"</strong></p><p>That would be so sweet if it wasn’t so tragic. “He was with me in New York, but still, he was like, ‘Um I'd like to schedule a picnic for next Friday because we need more quality time.’ And I was like, "Okay baby."' Lopez, of course, thought the whole thing was adorable, but we definitely think there is a much bigger underlining issue there. When a child asks to schedule time in that’s usually not a good sign.</p><h2 id=sarah-jessica-parker-likes-things-to-be-perfect><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker Likes Things To Be Perfect</strong></h2><p>We got wind of Sarah Jessica Parker’s level of perfectionism when emails from her were leaked last October. The emails detailed orders that she had for the staff including the nannies.</p><p><strong>“The orders include refilling a small Vaseline container for her kids regularly with a spoon or knife that has been washed twice and refilling her teen son’s body wash before he ever notices he’s running low.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also had an odd order request involving taco Tuesday which seemed to be a regular occurrence in their household. She told the nanny to buy “whatever meat goes in tacos.” That would be bizarre if it wasn’t so funny. If nothing else, the emails show that she is a true type-A personality and maybe just a little obsessed with cleanliness. She has three nannies, one for each child. She’s always wanted to be a hands-on mom, however, so she doesn’t have her nannies living with them. If that’s the case, then it was likely that she was the one getting up in the middle of the night to take care of her children. She walks her children to school as well, but the nannies are always with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rachel-zoe-likes-to-have-lots-of-help><strong>Rachel Zoe Likes to Have Lots of Help</strong></h2><p>Rachel Zoe is considered to be one of the stylish women in the industry. She’s an entrepreneur, stylist and designer and has her own reality show. She is a hard worker and that’s where the nannies come in. Women like Zoe aren’t the type to push strollers around, she’s far too stylish to do something like that. When she first became a mom, she realized pretty quickly she would have to hire some help to juggle her lifestyle. Their household is outnumbered by their staff and Zoe has two nannies for her two children. She also has a personal assistant as does her husband. Their assistants even have assistants and that doesn’t include their driver or their chef and that’s not even the half of it. She seems to love motherhood and everything that comes with it. “My priorities are very different now,” she explained to People. “There’s just nothing like it. I’m happy all the time.”</p><p><strong>“He and Skyler are starting to play together, which is amazing. They play hide and seek, and Skyler’s been a really incredible big brother,”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>she added. She certainly has all the help that she needs to make sure her life doesn’t get too crazy.</p><h2 id=jessica-alba-only-has-9-to-5-help><strong>Jessica Alba Only Has 9-to-5 Help</strong></h2><p>When it came to Jessica Alba's family, she decided to hire her nannies through referrals from family members instead of going through an agency which is what most Hollywood people do. She’s not only an actress but an entrepreneur which keeps her pretty busy. She likes to hire help that isn’t going to cost a fortune so she only has the nannies come in between 9 and 5 and she takes care of them the rest of the time. She’s likely one of the more hands-on moms that we have seen on the list. The nannies don’t stay overnight and they leave at the end of the workday. Her one nanny, Connie Simpson, taught Alba everything she ever needed to know about being a mom, including taking care of herself as well. She must really know what she’s doing because the nanny wrote a book called The Nanny Connie Way. Alba has often taken to social media to thank her nanny for helping her with everything from bathing to breastfeeding. She has more than one nanny, however. It’s not just Simpson that comes in to help. Having nannies around the house is certainly the best way to get the help that you’re looking for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonce-has-all-the-nannies><strong>Beyonce Has All The Nannies</strong></h2><p>Well, it certainly seems that way. When it comes to hiring nannies, Beyonce hires the most. She’s a strong female in the industry and she definitely has a busy schedule. She has three children now with Jay Z and apparently, it takes six nannies to care for them. Maybe she doesn’t like to be outdone by anyone, or maybe she just wants some peace and quiet around the house.</p><p><strong>“The twins don't sleep at the same time, so she decided she needed three per child, working in eight-hour shifts,"&nbsp;a source told OK! Magazine. Rumor has it that each nanny is paid $100,000 a year to take care of Beyoncé’s kids, so you know she’s not messing around.</strong></p><p>That’s pocket change considering how much she and Jay Z are worth. They do whatever it takes to make sure that their children are well taken care of. Beauty rest is very important to Beyonce so they had night nannies so that she would not be disturbed throughout the night. Each nanny will work in eight hour shifts and that way Beyonce knows she is getting the rest that she needs. Six nannies might just be a little much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=#>dailymail.co.uk,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>itsthevibe.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>okmagazine.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>screenertv.com,</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWKwprjEm2Smp52oeri106Fkpqeimnqvrc2noJ6rXam1orqMmpqtrZGheqy1w6xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
