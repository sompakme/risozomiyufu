She stated that she knew “something was going to happen,” but not to that extent.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Henson shared, “They were like, ‘Sit in this seat.’ I know what the camera seats are. So, I sat in the seat. I was so excited and he came to the stage [but] wasn’t ready to call me up yet. And he looked over my way and he was like ‘I see you, Taraji,’ and I thought that was my cue. And I ran up on the stage.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She called <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234776425>Ursher</a> “a female magnet,” explaining, “I don’t know if you know this, but you’re like drawn to him. So, cut to I’m in Paris [for] <a href=# data-type=pmc-gallery data-id=1234795224>Fashion Week</a>, and he’s performing there.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He’s in the audience doing his thing again and he sees Pharrell. And you know I know Pharrell,” she said cheekily. “So, he gives Pharrell his flowers and he looks across and goes, “Is that Taraji P. Henson?” And I swear to God, I took off running. And it’s <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234776198>something about him</a>. He’s a magnet, but you come in twerking. Promise you! Look at all the footage. It’s not just me!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Earlier in the segment, Henson joked about <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234781924>Beyoncé</a> ruining her <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234798355>Renaissance World Tour</a> outfit. She had her look planned out “months in advance,” but when Bey requested that <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234782994>fans wear silver </a>during her birthday season, the fellow Virgo had to rework her fit to align with the loosely-enforced dress code.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“My house is being renovated. All my clothes are in storage, and I randomly happened to just buy this off of one of those Instagram shopping pages,” she explained. “And when it came, I almost threw it away because it was paper thin. You could see through it, but at the end of the day, that’s all I had for <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234759873>Beyoncé</a>. It was kinda silver,” joked the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234622897>Baby Boy</a> star.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch her full sit-down with Fallon below, where she spoke her <a href=# data-type=post data-id=672261>TPH line </a>and other new endeavors.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6mus63JomSpZZiau7S7zWasrKCVp3qzsdKim56mk656o7HYqKWcnV2nsq%2BtyKyqmqaTmnpyfpJtbnJwZmuAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
