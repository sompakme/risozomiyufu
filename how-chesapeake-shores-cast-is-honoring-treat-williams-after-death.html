He’s just such a force and really the <a href=#>patriarch for our family</a> and a patriarch for me, personally.”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Williams, <a href=#>who died unexpectedly in June</a> at the age of 71 after being involved in a motorcycle accident, starred on Hallmark’s Chesapeake Shores alongside Huszar for six seasons prior to his passing. Williams portrayed Mick O’Brien on the&nbsp;heartwarming<b class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</b>series, while Huszar, for his part, played Luke Tatum — a love interest for Mick’s daughter Bree (<a href=#><strong>Emilie Ullerup</strong></a>).</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I just feel like Treat was a man who just really loved life and lived life to the fullest,” Huszar continued, calling Wiliams a “legendary” and “incredible” actor. “And he was doing something he loved when he went out. We all just keep him very close to our heart. It’s actually brought us back together.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Huszar had his own personal message for Williams as well, adding, “So if you’re hearing this brother, we miss you so much and you’ll be with us always.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Following his death, Hallmark also paid tribute to Williams, who also&nbsp;starred in several of&nbsp;the network’s&nbsp;projects over the years including 2020’s The Christmas House and<b>&nbsp;</b>its<b>&nbsp;</b>subsequent sequel.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p>We are heartbroken over the passing of beloved Treat Williams, star of Chesapeake Shores, The Christmas House and so much more,” the network wrote via Instagram at the time. “We will forever cherish him in our hearts, and extend our condolences to Treat’s family, friends, and loved ones.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stephen-Huszar-and-Chesapeake-Shore-Cast-Are-Celebrating-Treat-Williams-After-His-Death-227.jpg><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Williams’ <a href=#>costar <strong>Barbara Niven</strong>,</a> who played Williams’ onscreen&nbsp;wife Megan O’Brien on Chesapeake Shores, also took to social media to honor&nbsp;the actor following the “unexpected and immense loss.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Treat lived large and savored every bit of life. He loved his craft and it was an honor to spend six years with him on&nbsp;Chesapeake Shores. He truly was the patriarch of our family, both on and off the set. And he made it so much fun,’ she wrote via Instagram in June. “He would suddenly break into a song from&nbsp;Grease&nbsp;or&nbsp;Hair&nbsp;as we were rehearsing a scene, and came in with horrible dad jokes every day to make the crew laugh. What an actor he was. I think he was this generation’s Spencer Tracy.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Hallmark is known for its tight-knit group of actors. It’s <a href=#>that kind of “familiarity” that keeps</a> Huszar coming back for more projects.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Working with other performers and crew again, it’s just really nice. It’s family. It really feels like family,” Huszar gushed to Us about his time with the network. “It’s always nice to work with people you’ve worked with before [that have] your back and you’re just there to make a great artistic piece with each other and have fun while you do it. That’s the name of the game, isn’t it?”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>One artistic piece Huszar has certainly had fun making is his upcoming film A Royal Christmas Crush. The movie — which premieres July 8 and is part of Hallmark’s Christmas in July event — follows Huszar’s character, Prince Henry, as he finds unexpected love with architect Ava (Cassidy) when he comes to stateside to visit. The <a href=#>chemistry on set was so believable</a>,&nbsp;in fact, the twosome sparked a real-life romance.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“It’s hard to explain, but I just think the more [Katie and I] got to know each other, we realized <a href=#>we’re basically the same person</a>, just in a different skin. Which was odd. I’ve never met someone that’s so similar in ways than I am. It’s been quite a journey,” Huszar told Us of the couple’s blossoming romance, to which Cassidy, 36, added, “It’s like we finish each other’s sentences.”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6disKmx0pqnnpmbmnq0tM6rnKxlk5bAtXnIrGShp56kv6q6xmarq52RqXq4tculoJqlo2Kup8DEq2SdnZGptXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
