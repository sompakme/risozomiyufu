His mom, <strong>Mary Hobbs</strong>, confirmed his death to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Sun</a>, revealing that he had passed away on Wednesday, February 28, in Boone, North Carolina.</p><p>Hobbs told the publication that she “was with him” when the ATV accident occurred, “crushing” his skull and causing his death.</p><p>“He was just moving [the ATV] from one parking spot to the next for me, so I could back into park,” she told The Sun. “He pulled [in] front of me to park the ATV and the ground gave way from all the rain and mud.”</p><p>Hobbs said that the ATV flipped and fell on top of her son.</p><p>“I ran to neighbors trying to get someone to help me get the ATV off of him. No one answered. I ran back to him,” she added. “By that time, I realized he wasn’t alive anymore.”</p><p>She “laid next to him” while waiting for an ambulance.</p><p>Garinger appeared alongside Gutierrez, 20, during season 6B of 16 and Pregnant, which aired in March 2021.

He was my only son, my rock, my strength when I had none left,” Hobbs told The Sun of her late son. “We loved spontaneously jumping in the car for a road trip or a beach sesh. We bonded over music, fast cars and shooting guns and taking new adventures.”</p><p>She concluded: “Sean brightened my world in a way no one else could ever come close to. He was my baby boy, my squishy, my heartbeat.”</p><p>According to his obituary, Garinger is survived by sisters <strong>Shania</strong>, <strong>Lydia</strong>, <strong>Isabella</strong>, <strong>Ember</strong>, <strong>Kayden</strong> and <strong>Casslyn</strong>, along with his mother and daughters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZqbl2Wu6V5z6ucoKaRo8G0edKemKdll5a%2FqrrGnqlmnJWWsW6t02aYoJ1dZ31urcWtnKtlkanDbq3CnKCdnZ6pfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
