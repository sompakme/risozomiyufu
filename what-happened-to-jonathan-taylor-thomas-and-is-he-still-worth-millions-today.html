His career took off when he portrayed Randy Taylor on Home Improvement and voiced young Simba in Disney's 1994 animated feature film The Lion King. It was evident from his acting prowess and the colossal fanbase that Jonathan would have a successful career. He did, at least until he quit the hit show Home Improvement and later decided to start directing and producing.</p><p>Jonathan Taylor’s fans have had so many questions about the mysterious disappearance of Jonathan from the limelight. It’s not like he was running from any scandal or had a public breakdown. So, what happened to Jonathan Taylor Thomas? This article will dive deeper into what the actor has been up to and his net worth in 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jonathan-taylor-thomas-rose-to-fame-on-home-improvement>Jonathan Taylor Thomas Rose To Fame On Home Improvement</h2><h3 id=jonathan-taylor-quit-home-improvement-to-focus-on-college-and-education>Jonathan Taylor quit Home Improvement to focus on college and education</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jonathan-taylor-thomas-pictured-in-1998.jpg><p>The actor began his career pretty early in his life. Jonathan was born in 1981 and made his acting debut in 1990 on The Bradys, a spinoff of an older sitcom The Brady Bunch. The child idol would appear in a few other TV shows before landing a breaking role in the soon-to-be hit show Home Improvement show alongside Tim Allen.</p><p>This show opened more opportunities for JTT, landing him roles in The Lion King and The Adventures of Pinocchio. However, on the 8-season show’s final leg (second episode of season 8 ), Jonathan called it quits. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor later revealed that he wanted to focus more on college and education</a>, and the workload of Home Improvement wouldn’t have allowed that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tim-allen-can-live-on-home-improvement-reruns-alone-but-did-patricia-richardson-lose-out-on-millions_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tim Allen Can Live On Home Improvement Reruns Alone But Did Patricia Richardson Lose Out On Millions?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Patricia Richardson might have lost the opportunity to make a fortune when she said goodbye to the popular sitcom Home Improvement.</span><p>“I’d been going nonstop since I was 8 years old,” Thomas told PEOPLE. “I wanted to go to school, to travel, and have a bit of a break.”</p><p>JTT did not return to the show, something that apparently did not impress his co-stars, Tim Allen and Patricia Richardson. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was speculated that Thomas snubbed the finale because he was mad at Allen</a> for initially questioning his motive for leaving the show.</p><p>“He said it was about going to school, but then he did some films. Did he want to do films? Did he want to go to school? Allen told TV Guide. “It got mixed up in the translation.”</p><p>It is not only Thomas who gave up the show for personal reasons. <a href=#>Patricia Richardson turned down a $25 million offer to keep the show going</a> for a ninth season only because it was half of what Tim Allen was offered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jonathan-taylor-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-16-million-in-2024>Jonathan Taylor’s Net Worth Is $16 Million In 2024</h2><h3 id=jonathan-taylor-earned-8-000-per-episode-on-home-improvement>Jonathan Taylor earned $8,000 per episode on Home Improvement</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jonathan-taylor-thomas.jpg><p>Jonathan Taylor appeared on Home Improvement for seven seasons, and as the show grew to be one of the most popular teen sitcoms, Jonathan grew with it, landing himself other roles in films. All these combined made him quite a net worth. <a href=#>It is speculated that Jonathan raked in $8000 per episode on Home Improvement</a>. Although that figure isn’t precise, it is not a secret that the producers hugely incentivized their cast with money to keep the show going.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tim-allen.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Casey Wilson Called Her Time With Tim Allen, "The Single Worst Experience" She Ever Had In Hollywood</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Casey Wilson slammed Tim Allen for his behavior on set of The Santa Clauses.</span><p>Today, <a href=#>Thomas’s net worth continued to grow after Home Improvement</a> to around $16M. Although not a small figure, it cannot be compared to the net worth of some of his former co-stars, Tim Allen and Patricia Richardson. His unprecedented exit from the show and retirement from the spotlight may have something to do with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-jonathan-taylor-thomas-is-making-money-today>How Jonathan Taylor Thomas Is Making Money Today</h2><h3 id=jonathan-taylor-has-managed-to-stay-under-the-radar-since-his-appearance-in-last-man-standing>Jonathan Taylor has managed to stay under the radar since his appearance in Last Man Standing</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jonathan-taylor-thomas.jpg><p>A lot surrounds Jonathan Thomas’s exit from Home Improvement in 1998, his refusal to return and fade to oblivion. After leaving the '90s hit show, Thomas was in between school and doing a few small film projects before making several camera appearances in Last Man Standing in 2013.</p><p>An appearance alongside Tim Allen on Last Man Standing was the last Thomas’s fans would see of him. Well, not until 2021 and later in 2023 was he spotted near his South California home rocking facial hair, a Lacoste sweater over a green shirt, and a pair of blue jeans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/your-paragraph-text-2023-08-02t163355-632.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tim Allen's Relationship With Jonathan Taylor Thomas Did Not End Well On Home Improvement</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jonathan Taylor Thomas wasn't completely direct on his reason to leave Tim Allen and Home Improvement behind.</span><p>It is plausible how the actor, who has appeared in some popular films and shows and switched collages, has managed to stay under the radar for too long. As of 2024, the actor seems to be on an acting hiatus or retirement, and little is known about what he has been up to.</p><p><a href=#>Jonathan’s Home Improvement Co-stars are still going hard in the industry</a>, with Tim Allen's continued relationship with Disney and Patricia Richardson's appearance in Grey's Anatomy — a successful drama series.
