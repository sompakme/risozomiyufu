According to CNBC, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the first software company Elon founded in 1995, Zip2</a>, was made with the help of Kimbal, and eventually sold for about $300 million in 1999.</p><p>With that, it's safe to say that they have a longstanding history together. After describing his brother's relationship with Heard as a "nightmare," Kimbal had this to say about the SpaceX CEO's dating history: "It's really sad that he falls in love with these people who are really mean to him. They're beautiful, no question, but they have a very dark side and Elon knows they are toxic."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-amber-heard-39-s-behavior-influence-kimbal-musk-39-s-opinion-of-her>How Did Amber Heard's Behavior Influence Kimbal Musk's Opinion Of Her?</h2><p>Elon Musk's relationship with Amber Heard, like <a href=#>her unstable marriage to Johnny Depp and many of her other highly-publicized romances</a>, was extremely tumultuous and included periods of separation and reconciliation. According to People, Musk first took an interest in Heard in 2013, after seeing her in Machete Kills, a film that both him and Heard were a part of. However, she rejected the meeting arrangement because, at the time, she was married to Johnny Depp. They finally met several years later, in 2015, and were rumored to be secretly dating around that time. Around July 2016, they were seen together in the lobby of various luxurious hotels, merely months after Heard filed for divorce from Johnny Depp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Does-Amber-Heard-Feel-About-Elon-Musks-Twitter-Takeover_.jpg><p>One year later, in July 2017, Elon Musk and Amber Heard announced that they had split up. But they reconciled just five months later, which is when Kimbal's suspicions about Amber Heard were confirmed after Elon, Heard, Kimbal, his wife, and kids took a trip to Brazil in December 2017. <strong>Here is a list of the highlights of Elon and Amber's relationship, according to People:</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>May 2016 - Met for the first time at the 2016 Met Gala</strong></li><li><strong>July 2016 - Elon and Amber spotted at the Delano South Beach hotel, Miami</strong></li><li><strong>August 2016 - Musk and Amber seen leaving The Box nightclub in London</strong></li><li><strong>April 2017 - Heard and Musk make their romance official on Instagram</strong></li><li><strong>May 2017 - Heard and Musk are seen strolling together during a date night in Australia</strong></li><li><strong>August 2017 - Elon Musk and Amber Heard announce their break-up</strong></li></ul><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/do-amber-heard-s-bullying-accusations-against-jason-momoa-and-director-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Truth About Amber Heard's Bullying Accusations Against Jason Momoa And Director James Wan On The Set Of 'Aquaman 2'">The Truth About Amber Heard's Bullying Accusations Against Jason Momoa And Director James Wan On The Set Of 'Aquaman 2'</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>After losing the defamation trial against Johnny Depp, Amber Heard accused her co-star Jason Momoa and director James Wan of harassment and bullying.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Daily Mail</a>, Kimbal witnessed Elon Musk and Amber Heard get into an explosive fight when they arrived at their hotel. The Aquaman actress locked herself in a room and "started yelling she was afraid she would be attacked and that Elon had taken her passport." Kimbal alluded to the fact that her behavior was exaggerated in this statement, 'She really is a very good actress so she will say things that you're like: "Wow, maybe she's telling you the truth", but she isn't.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-elon-musk-39-s-father-to-blame-for-his-toxic-relationship-with-amber-heard>Is Elon Musk's Father To Blame For His Toxic Relationship With Amber Heard?</h2><p>Fortunately, Elon Musk and Amber Heard's relationship never got to the point of marriage, but the tech mogul had been divorced three times before his year-long love affair with Amber. However, the relationship that proceeded after his breakup with Amber came in 2018 with <a href=#>Canadian musician, Grimes, with whom Elon has three children.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/elon-musk-looking-unsure.jpg><p>Like Kimbal, Grimes also observed the volatility that surrounded Heard, and even told Walter Isaacson when interviewed for Elon Musk's biography that, "He's attracted to chaotic evil." Of course, she was pointing out that Amber was the source of this chaotic evil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/amber-heard-and-jason-momoa-had-a-complicated-relationship-long-before-working-on-aquaman-together.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Amber Heard And Jason Momoa Had A Complicated Relationship Long Before Working On Aquaman Together ">Amber Heard And Jason Momoa Had A Complicated Relationship Long Before Working On Aquaman Together</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Heard and Momoa appear to be close friends, but some of the behind-the-scenes details paint a more confusing picture.</p><p>Grimes also went on to blame Elon Musk's father, Errol Musk, for his relationship with Amber Heard and his tendency to attract toxic love affairs. The 'Genesis' singer said this about why she believes Elon's upbringing with his father has had an impact on the type of women he attracts: "It's about his father and what he grew up with, and he is quick to fall back into being treated badly. He associates love with being mean or abusive." Elon himself has also described his relationship with Amber as "brutal," and has said that he is often a "fool for love."</p><h2 id=what-does-elon-musk-think-about-his-relationship-with-amber-heard>What Does Elon Musk Think About His Relationship With Amber Heard?</h2><p>When Walter Isaacson asked Elon Musk about his seemingly innocuous relationship with Amber Heard, he summed it up by saying, "It was brutal." And judging from the defamation case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, "brutal" may be an understatement. While Musk and Heard have expressed their undying love and friendship for each other after the break-up, reports of the effects her toxicity had on him came from sources other than Kimbal and Grimes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-2.png><p>Musk's chief of staff, Sam Teller, compared Amber Heard's unsettling presence in Elon Musk's life to a comic book villain. He said, "She was like the Joker in Batman. She didn't have a goal or aim other than chaos. She thrives on destabilizing everything."</p><p>Teller also observed how their heated arguments and fights meant, "Musk would have to stay up all night fighting... and then he would not be able to get up until the afternoon." Obviously, if she didn't care about his mental health and productivity, <a href=#>Elon would wonder whether Heard ever liked him to begin with.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpaeeYrq2v8qsZJuqn6m1pr6Mq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZpmdl7KzeceemKucXaO2qLTTppirnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
