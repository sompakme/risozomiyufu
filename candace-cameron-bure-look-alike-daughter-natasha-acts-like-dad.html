Like when I asked her if she could be my model, she was like, ‘Of course I will.’”</p><p>While the <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars </a>alum and Natasha don’t share clothes, Natasha does give Candace “really great tips on styling.”</p><p>The former <a href=#>View</a> cohost <a href=#>loved having a “full house” while quarantining</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic last year, exclusively telling Us at the time that having Natasha, Lev and Maksim at home was “the biggest blessing.”</p><p>Candace explained in April 2020: “Our conversations have been incredible. They’ve been great. We’ve been taking lots of walks and playing lots of board games and we’re in sunny California. We have a pool and we’ve been enjoying that too because the weather’s been nice. It’s just been concentrated family time [with] lots of cooking and eating.”</p><p>The family time did come to an end eventually — but the Dancing Through Life author hopes that her Aurora Teagarden Mysteries never do.</p><p>“I hope we do many, many more of these movies,” she gushed to Us of the franchise. “But even if we don’t make more movies, I think Aurora is going to still be solving crimes in her little fantasy world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: Honeymoon, Honeymurder airs on Hallmark Movies + Mysteries Sunday, August 22, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Sarah Hearon</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmZ6ZrqSxjJyYpp2ipLturtSrnGakn6S4bq3LoqKeZZSWwqi0056pZqaRqa60tMBmmJyso2K5qrfEZpuanF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
