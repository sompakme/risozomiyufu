In 2018, seemingly broke and alone, André faced eviction from his White Plains mansion. Although the fashion-barrier-breaker claimed that he owned the property, ex-Manolo Blahnik CEO George Malkemus stated that he did not, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and he accused Talley of owing $500,000 in rent.</a></p><p>As far as the public knows, Talley received little to no help from Wintour, who had not long before fired him as Vogue’s official red-carpet Met Gala interviewer, choosing to replace the veteran with a younger, hipper YouTube star.</p><p>Following this slight, Talley sadly said of the industry that once heralded him a superstar “Fashion does not take care of its people.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Surprising Reactions to Kendall Jenner's Vogue Series About Her Crippling Anxiety</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5yimnqtsc6nZK2ZnKGyunnEsaClnV2brrS0yKilZqGemcK0wNGyZJ2dkam1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
