He described how he was shocked, as he stated that he wasn’t ready to retire.</p><p>“I was pulled aside by Triple H and he mentioned to me, ‘Rey, we would love to induct you into the Hall of Fame,” Mysterio said. “It was very shocking to me. It was like, ‘Wow.’ I remember the first words that came out of my mouth were just like, ‘I’m not ready to retire.’ He’s like, ‘No, it’s not like that.’”</p><p>The legend went on to explain that he’s having a hard time processing his looming induction into the WWE Hall of Fame, as the milestone is supposed to come when a wrestler either retires or enters the stage of their career where they’re getting close, and he doesn’t feel like either benchmark apply to him.</p><p>“I’m still having a hard time digesting it because Hall of Fames are supposed to happen when you retire, when you’re getting close to retirement,” Mysterio said. “I don’t feel neither of them are close for me, but it’s a huge blessing.”</p><p>Mysterio also stated that his new retirement number is 50, and he wants to keep it there. He noted that he’s hopeful that he’ll be able to step back once that time comes.</p><p>“I think I do have a number and I want to keep it at that and my number is 50,” Mysterio said. “I’m hoping at 50 I can go ahead and say it’s been an incredible ride and I think it’s time for me to step back now.”</p><p>The WWE Hall of Fame Ceremony will be on on March 31. Mysterio will face his son, Dominik Mysterio, at WWE WrestleMania 39.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJvaG1pY2K%2FpsWMprCsrJWntrB5zqdkq52RmMGqu81mq6hlmJa5rXnOn2SfmZ2aeqq6w66araGfo3qquYynpq1lopqupcWMraZmqpWptrOx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
