Pumpkin painting and Halloween parties are normally fun — until a former flame walks through the door.</p><p>Actress <strong><a href=#>Camilla Belle</a></strong> and football player <strong>Tim Tebow</strong>, who dated briefly in 2012, attended the Just Jared Pre-Halloween Party Sponsored by FIJI Water and WONKA Candy at Beacher’s Madhouse in L.A.&nbsp;on Thursday along with <strong><a href=#>Ashley Greene</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Hilary Duff</a></strong>.</p><p>While Belle, 27, animatedly spoke with Duff, she made zero contact with Tebow, 26, at the event. "[They] never once spoke, sat on the same side of the room or even made any eye contact," an insider reveals to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. "She was pretty low key, there with some girlfriends," the source adds. Former Broncos and Jets player Tebow attended the event with two guy friends and thanked the party's host on his way out. Even with the stylish Push star within close proximity, there was "still no interaction whatsoever."</p><p>The insider adds, "Once he left, Camilla finally got up out of her seat and wandered about — there was definitely some weird tension there."</p><p>The icy encounter follows Belle's somewhat warmer run-in with another ex-boyfriend just one week ago. She was spotted at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts Grand Inaugural Gala in Beverly Hills on Oct. 17 sharing a lively discussion with <strong><a href=#>Joe Jonas</a></strong>, whom she dated from 2008-2009. The former lovebirds <a href=#>appeared</a> to be on good terms, even ending their chat at the event with a big hug."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A devout Christian and current free agent, Tebow described to <a href=#>Vogue</a> in a Sept. 2012 interview what qualities he looks for in a significant other: "Obviously, looks play a big part," he said. Being attracted to someone plays a big part, but there's also so much more than that for me." The football player shared, "It's about finding someone sweet and kind, and that has a servant's heart. It's about finding a girl who likes me for me, and not because of what I do or who I am or the name."&nbsp;</p><p>The athlete has been incorrectly linked to Taylor Swift and actress <strong><a href=#>Dianna Agron</a>.</strong> Belle, meanwhile, is the star of Enrique Iglesias' new "Heart Attack" music video, which dropped Friday, Oct. 25.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZ1iwaauzrBknJmdnrmtrYybnKWklWKut7vInWSemZOderDAx56pZqCRobmww8SepWaokafBunmRaWhsamVmfXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
