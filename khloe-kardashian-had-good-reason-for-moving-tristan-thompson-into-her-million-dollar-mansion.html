Tristan’s roof caved in on his home and caused flooding.”</p><p>“So Tristan and [his youngest brother] Amari are staying at my house now until his home gets fixed,” she continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Khloe has been physically and vocally supportive of Tristan since his mother passed away in January, despite their complicated history. Khloe recalls the moment Tristan called to tell her that his mother, Andrea, had died.</p><p>“Tristan called me. I didn’t really understand what he was saying,” she said in the episode. “He was just screaming on the phone trying to tell me that she is gone. But I had no idea what he was talking about. I was really close to Andrea. We spoke every single day.”</p><p>“Andrea is only 53 years old and she leaves behind four boys: Dishawn, Daniel and Amari. And Amari is 16 and he is severely disabled and it is just really sad,” she continued. “Because we don’t know what he knows or doesn’t know cognitively.”</p><p>Later in the episode, Tristan expressed his gratefulness for the Kardashians for being there for him during such a difficult time. “Thank you so much — especially for me and my family — I don’t know what I would do without you guys,” he said on camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Khloe has a handful of properties in California</a>, so it’s unclear which one Tristan and Amari stayed at, and whether Khloe and her kids were there at the same time. It’s also not known if Tristan is still staying under Khloe’s roof.</p><p>But Khloe is preparing to move to an even bigger property. Earlier this year, it was reported that <a href=#>construction had been completed on side-by-side mansions</a> that Khloe is building with her mom, Kris Jenner. They bought the plot of land in 2020 to create custom homes, which are now ready.</p><p>Khloe’s younger sister <a href=#>Kylie Jenner is also preparing to move nearby</a>, as she’s building a mega mansion almost next door, though reports say it’ll take years to complete.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Margot Robbie Paid Off Her Mom’s Mortgage With First Big Acting Paycheck</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, <a href=#>Love Property</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmakoJyksm63wKubmquYnq6veceam2afn6Sxbr7Emqqopl2bvLN5zKitoqaXYsGztdKtmKdlpJ28rrzSqKVmoZ6pvG60xKtkpqGcobawuoydpqWkkad6rq3NrKCopl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
