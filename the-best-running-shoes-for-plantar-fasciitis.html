While researchers don’t yet understand why it develops, they know what exacerbates it: an increase in activity level and a lack of proper support and cushioning in your shoes.</p><p>In general, you’ll want to look for a running shoe that has a balance of support and cushioning with a contoured footbed. The outsole should also provide sturdiness to keep your foot in alignment and shock absorption to reduce the impact on your feet. Lastly, a higher shoe drop is considered better for plantar fasciitis patients. (The drop refers to the height difference between the heel and the forefoot. The greater the drop, the more your foot tips forward.) Below, we break down important factors to consider before buying a running shoe for plantar fasciitis.</p><h2 class=section-title>What to Consider When Choosing the Best Running Shoes for Plantar Fasciitis</h2><h3><strong>Arch Support</strong></h3><p>A lack of adequate arch support is one of the most common causes of plantar fasciitis. Without it, the plantar fascia in your feet can become even more irritated and strained. So, we recommend choosing a running shoe that provides moderate to high arch support depending on the height of your arch. Ideally, that support places your feet in an optimal position and properly distributes your bodyweight.</p><h3><strong>Cushioning</strong></h3><p>Too much cushioning isn’t a good thing for plantar fasciitis because it doesn’t provide enough support. The right amount of cushioning, however, can alleviate heel pain quickly. Look for shoes that have padding in the heel and forefoot which helps reduce shock to the plantar fascia.</p><h3><strong>Contoured Footbed</strong></h3><p>A contoured footbed acts similarly to an orthotic without feeling too stiff. In an ideal shoe, the footbed keeps your feet in proper alignment without creating discomfort. It should also provide proper heel cupping, meaning they cradle the heel and distribute shock.</p><h3><strong>Outsole</strong></h3><p>An outsole can help alleviate heel pain if it provides good traction and shock absorption, both of which can reduce strain on the plantar fascia. Look for a running shoe that has a sturdy yet flexible outsole, which will allow your foot to move naturally. It should also have decent shock absorption to reduce impact on the heel. Generally, rubber is the best outsole material because it provides traction and extends the life of the shoe.</p><h3><strong>Price</strong></h3><p>There is a wide price range for plantar fasciitis running shoes, and the brand, shoe design, features and materials can all influence cost. In general, these sneakers cost between $50 and $300.</p><p>We chose to recommend shoes between $50 and $200. While we believe that investing in a good shoe is important, we recognize that all running shoes need replacing <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">between 300 and 500 miles</a></strong>, and purchasing expensive shoes every time they need replacing isn’t financially sustainable.</p><h2 class=section-title>What Are the Different Types of Running Shoes for Plantar Fasciitis?</h2><p>While there aren’t specific categories to describe running shoes for plantar fasciitis, all running shoes can be broken down into three categories: stability, motion control and neutral.</p><h3><strong>Stability</strong></h3><p>Stability shoes are designed to prioritize proper foot alignment. They offer a balance of cushioning and support thanks to cushioned midsoles, soft interiors and ample arch support. Generally, these shoes feel firmer than motion control and neutral sneakers. They’re best for runners who overpronate, or have ankles that roll inward as they walk or run, but they tend to weigh more.</p><h3><strong>Motion Control</strong></h3><p>Motion control shoes, also called high-stability shoes, are great for flat-footed runners who weigh over 180 pounds. They’re the most stable shoe type on the market, and therefore they also work well for people with severe overpronation. These shoes have stiff exteriors and maintain a straight, inflexible shape as you run or walk.</p><p>We recommend speaking to a podiatrist before purchasing motion control running shoes, because they may not be the right kind of shoe for you. Your podiatrist may recommend them if you have chronic injuries or a certain foot abnormality that affects your gait.</p><h3><strong>Neutral</strong></h3><p>Neutral running shoes are the most common type of running shoes. They’re designed for runners who have a neutral pronation — when the foot rolls inward only slightly during walks or runs but stays in alignment. Generally, neutral running shoes provide a good balance of cushioning and stability while still allowing your feet to move as they normally would.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6eyt7XEsKpompWowW6%2B1KeloqaXYsCpu8SsZKmkkaPBor6Mn5ism5mewaq%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
