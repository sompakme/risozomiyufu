Name a more iconic&nbsp;friendship.</p><p>They are two&nbsp;beautiful, talented, Aussie blondes, and we can't handle the level of cuteness that is their 35-year friendship. Sure there are tons of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity friendships</a> out there like Johnny Depp and Tim Burton's, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's</a>, and even weirder, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Martha Stewart and Snoop Dog's friendship.</a>&nbsp;But none can compare to Kidman and Watts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through ups and downs in their careers and personal lives, they are always there for each other. Nothing can come between them, even when they go up for the same parts...in separate films...at the same time. Read on and take a closer look at their friendship.</p><h2 id=they-met-on-the-set-of-flirting>They Met On The Set Of 'Flirting'</h2><p>The most successful and truest celebrity friendships happen when two celebrities meet before they're famous. Everyone wants to be your friend when you're famous, so it's good that Kidman and Watts met each other before they were big movie stars. They know&nbsp;what their friendship is really based on. It's not fake.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They attended the same high school and then later on the same theater company</a>, but didn't get fully acquainted with one another until they starred in&nbsp;Flirting, an Australian dramedy, together in 1991. Kidman had already done a lot of other Australian films and shows, but Watts only had a couple of projects under her belt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We already knew each other but that’s when our friendship forged," Watts told People.</p><p>Later on, in 2001, Kidman presented Watts with a Movieline award for her performance in David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive.&nbsp;Watts had been looking up to her friend ever since co-starring together. "The fact that we’ve come from the same place gave me hope for myself," she said.</p><p>Kidman told USA Today that she knew she had to support her friend by presenting the award because Watts had supported her and her then-husband, Tom Cruise, at their movie premieres. "Finally to be able to give back to her on the same level is really lovely," Kidman said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HBO Has Canceled The 'Game Of Thrones' Prequel Starring Naomi Watts</a></span></p><p>Kidman also wound up supporting her again by being her date (along with Heath Ledger) to the premiere of Watts' The Ring in 2002.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2005, Kidman told The Telegraph, "Naomi and I are very, very good friends and have maintained that through so many things. I think that’s really rare, particularly for actresses, and I take a lot of pride in that."</p><p>They held hands on the red carpets and presented&nbsp;at the 2007 Oscars too, and later in the year, Kidman told The Early Show, how proud she was of Watts for being "determined."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Reacts To Nicole Kidman, Javier Bardem In Talks For Lucille Ball Biopic</a></span></p><p>But that determination stemmed from all the support she was getting from Kidman. In 2013, Watts told CBS Sunday Morning that if she hadn't had Kidman's continued support her career would have died in the '90s. "She kept saying, ‘It’s just going to take one thing, one thing, Nay, and you know, if you’re in a hit film … then everything changes,’" she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In early 2015, Watts surprised Kidman on stage while she was hosting the G’Day USA Gala, and later on in the year, they revealed that they were looking for a film to star in together, but they were picky. That year, Watts also resented Kidman with the Excellence in Film honors at the Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards.</p><p>The next time Watts talked about her friendship with Kidman&nbsp;was in 2017. She told People, "We’ve gone through a lot together over a significant amount of time. That history binds you. We have a strong respect and love for one another." Watts also revealed that she and Kidman had talked about Watts appearing in Kidman's hit HBO series Big Little Lies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That year was also a milestone for them as they celebrated 30 years of friendship. Kidman revealed that they had a huge party to celebrate. "We were wild that night! We’re proud of that. That’s a really important thing to emphasize the friendships that have sustained decades and decades."</p><h2 id=they-played-the-same-character-in-different-projects-the-same-year>They Played The Same Character In Different Projects...The Same Year</h2><p>In 2018, it was reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kidman and Watts were both set to star as Gretchen Carlson in separate projects</a>, Kidman&nbsp;in&nbsp;the film Bombshell, and Watts in the mini-series The Loudest Voice in the Room. We wonder what they thought about that.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Kidman Dishes on Producing 'Big Little Lies' With Reese Witherspoon</a></span></p><p>Apparently, it didn't affect their relationship whatsoever because Kidman was posting about celebrating Watts' 50th birthday anniversary.</p><p>"Happy Birthday to my gorgeous friend Nai - IT’S A BIG ONE! Friends for the last 35 years, here’s to another 35 together and celebrating with your girlfriends. Love you so much. #birthdaywishes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, the pair have stayed close, obviously, only this past year they probably didn't see much of each other due to quarantine.</p><p>But this past April, Kidman was thinking of her bestie when she posted a hilarious throwback photo of them together on her Instagram. "My earliest <a class=xil3i href=#>#WCW</a>’s," she wrote. Watts responded by writing, "Love you ladies so much I love you."</p><p>This past November, Watts has commented on a possible film with Kidman, saying, "Wouldn't&nbsp;that be great?"</p><p>All we know is that we need something with them in it together. Maybe they could make a film where they&nbsp;play sisters who live in Australia. But then that would just be a documentary of their lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Tom Cruise And Nicole Kidman Have A Good Marriage?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51do7aku8ueZKShlKKur3nAp5tmppGkuqp51pqrratdqMGquMtmmZ6rpGKzs7XEp5usZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
