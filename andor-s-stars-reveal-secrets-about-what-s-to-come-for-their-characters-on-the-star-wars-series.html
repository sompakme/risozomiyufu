This, unfortunately, includes both <a href=#>Boba Fett, which had a number of issues</a>, and Ewan McGregor's return as the titular character in Obi-Wan. Even parts of the latest season of The Mandalorian, one of Disney+'s biggest successes, weren't everything fans wanted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Andor certainly won't please everyone, it has a lot of things going for it. At least, so far. At the time of this writing, only the first few episodes have been released.</p><p>One aspect of the show that's working is its cast of characters. Aside from Diego Luna, who reprises his role from Rogue One, the series is stacked with talented supporting actors who fill out this gritty world.</p><p>During a couple of stellar interviews with The Hollywood Reporter, a few of the supporting actors shed some much-needed light on their characters and what fans can expect from them.</p><h2 id=genevieve-o-rsquo-reilly-reveals-secrets-about-mon-mothma>Genevieve O’Reilly Reveals Secrets About Mon Mothma</h2><p>Genevieve O'Reilly is Mon Mothma. Of course, Caroline Blakiston originally played the former leader of the Galactic Senate Loyalist faction for about 30 seconds in Return of the Jedi. But Genevieve has inhabited the character many more times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her first appearance was in George Lucas' Revenge of the Sith all the way back in 2005. She was later brought back for 2016's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. She has even lent her voice to the character in Star Wars Rebels. But now, she has a real chance to dig deeper into the character over the course of multiple episodes of Andor.</p><p>"I’ve always been really curious about this woman. I’ve had questions about her all the way along, and as actors, we kind of fill in bits for ourselves," Genevieve said in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ewan McGregor Once Thought He Would Never Return To Play Obi-Wan Again</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We know that she is dignified and bolstered by her ideals. We know that she is a truth-teller. We see her try to effect change from within the Empire, and we see that it is a very lonely experience."</p><p>She continued by saying, "There are few people willing to stand with her against Palpatine, against this collective oppression. And we see her try to navigate and find exit routes for herself to be effective, to try and be a part of the change. And I think it’s okay to say that it’s not easy and not all of those choices are black and white."</p><h2 id=denise-gough-reveals-secrets-about-dedra-meero>Denise Gough Reveals Secrets About Dedra Meero</h2><p>Dedra Meero is a supervisor for the Imperial Security Bureau and is a completely new character created for Disney+'s Andor. Audiences know very little about her so far, aside from the fact that she is among two women in her position.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I spoke to [creator] Tony [Gilroy] about what Dedra has come from, she didn’t come from much. She’s an outsider, and she’s looking for a way to be important and to be considered important," actor Denise Gough said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>"She wants to find control and to be able to be in a position of power so that she can feel in control. And in this industry that she’s in, she looks around and sees a lot of men of privilege being able to just kind of wing it, and it’s not in Dedra’s nature to wing it. So she obviously has to work twice as hard as anyone else there, maybe because of the fact that she’s a woman."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Samuel L. Jackson Could Return To The Star Wars Universe</a></span></p><p>Denise went on to say that the show is unlikely to go too deep into Dedra's history. But she did say that it is almost certainly filled with a lot of pain. And this pain drives her need for control as it will bring her a feeling of safety.</p><h2 id=kyle-soller-reveals-secrets-about-syril-karn>Kyle Soller Reveals Secrets About Syril Karn</h2><p>Just like Denise's Dedra, Kyle Soller's Syril Karn is desperate for control. We see this early on with his OCD-like behavior, particularly when it comes to his Imperial uniform.</p><p>"There is high-level anxiety going on beneath the surface, which was actually going on for Syril the entire time," Kyle said to The Hollywood Reporter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He comes from a difficult background, which we actually get a view into as the series develops. His specificity comes with judgment, but it’s out of a fear that things are out of his control. So I do know that detectives with OCD are actually more effective at their job, and so I thought, 'Oh, this is a match made in heaven.'"</p><h2 id=adria-arjona-reveals-secrets-about-bix-caleen>Adria Arjona Reveals Secrets About Bix Caleen</h2><p>Adria Arjona's Bix Caleen may be Cassian Andor's love interest in the series. Although, at the time of this writing, it's only implied that they've had a history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I know they’ve had a long friendship. They’re childhood friends, and there’s this mystery of, 'Were they ever really in love? Were they ever together? Is there jealousy between Cassian and Timm? Is this a love triangle?'" Adria Arjona explained to Vulture.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About The Creation Of The 'Star Wars' Prequel Trilogy</a></span></p><p>Bix seemingly has her life together with a job as a mechanic and a relationship with Timm (played by James McArdle). But like any good old flame, Cassian throws a wrench into all that whenever he appears.</p><p>"She finally has stability, but every time Cassian comes in, he just disrupts it a little bit. So she almost wishes better for Cassian, and she’s incredibly protective over him. But she always ends up picking him over everything, and it kind of sucks."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZmiYsSivtJmmpqrpGKur7DOq2SwoJ9irrOxjK2fnmWTna6zrcKtnKurXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
