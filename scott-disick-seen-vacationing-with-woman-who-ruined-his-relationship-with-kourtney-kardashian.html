The duo have been infamously on-and-off in the past, though they haven’t been linked in nearly a decade.</p><p>Scott and Chloe’s romance isn’t only raising eyebrows amongst fans because of their age difference, but also because of their history. Chloe was allegedly part of the reason Kourtney broke up with Scott for good in 2015, shortly after they welcomed their third child, son Reign.</p><p>Photos published in July 2015 showed Scott and Chloe together in Monte Carlo, while Kourtney presumably was home with their newborn. Moreover, Scott had allegedly been unfaithful in the past, a topic that explored on Keeping Up on the Kardashians numerous times.</p><p>Scott did later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">address their break-up in the show</a>, admitting his actions were to blame.

She's happy and glowing."</p><p>Kourtney began dating Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker in 2021 and they married last year in multiple ceremonies, including a star-studded one in Italy.
