However, as hard as fellow celebs may try to bring the reality TV family down a notch or two, no one has been able to challenge their growing empire. If anything, the drama only adds to the Kardashian’s appeal and helps them stay relevant for even longer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These fifteen celebrities all tried to take a hit at the Kardashians at one point or another. From scorned ex lovers, ignored family members and fellow celebrities who are tired of the famous family for getting attention over their looks, there are a lot of people who definitely don’t want to keep up with the Kardashians. However, the Kardashians put all of these enemies in their place in one way or another, so we’d think twice before crossing the Kardashians.</p><h2 id=blac-chyna-a-lot-of-baby-mama-drama><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Blac Chyna: a lot of baby mama drama<b></b></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Blac Chyna has had a very long history with the Kardashians, but so far she hasn’t been able to dethrone them. Her beef with the famous family began when Kylie Jenner began dating Tyga, the father of Chyna’s son, King Cairo. Rumour has it that Tyga left Chyna so he could begin dating the then-underage Kylie, which obviously didn’t sit well with his scorned baby mama.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>To get revenge, Chyna began dating Kylie’s older half brother Rob, which the Kardashians felt weird about right away. In a whirlwind romance, Rob and Chyna had daughter Dream and got engaged in less than a year. But things between them began falling apart after their daughter’s birth. Their drama climaxed when Rob went on a social media rampage against Chyna and released her nude pics online.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In retaliation, Chyna has since gotten a restraining order and filed a domestic abuse lawsuit against Rob. She’s also currently suing the entire Kardashian Klan for allegedly getting her reality show axed after the first season. However, as much as Chyna is trying to take the Kardashians down a notch, the family seemingly hasn’t been impacted by her. They’ve distanced themselves from her in the media and have hired a great team of defense attorneys. Chyna definitely hasn’t gotten the revenge she hoped for.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bella-thorne-made-the-mistake-of-dating-scott><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Bella Thorne: made the mistake of dating Scott</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Bella Thorne stirred up a ton of drama this past summer when she began having a ‘friends-with-benefits’ type fling with Scott Disick, the father of Kourtney Kardashian’s three children. Sources said the Kardashian Klan was disgusted the reality star was carrying on with a girl 15-years younger than him, and they were convinced that Bella was only using him to increase her popularity.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>At the time, a source said that Bella was actually ratting on Scott to Kourtney, in hopes that the Kardashians would help up her star power. “She tells Kourtney all the dirty things Scott is doing, and in return, the Kardashians have promised to help boost Bella’s career,” the source said. But they warned, “That family looks out for itself and no one else. Bella’s always been obsessed with the Kardashians and thinks they’ll take her under their wing. But the minute Scott drops her, they will too.”</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>But that looks like what has happened! Since Scott ditched her, the Kardashians seemingly have as well. Instead of helping her fame, her brief fling with Scott only added fuel to her wild girl image and made her hated by the Kardashian fans. This is proof that you should never try to hook up with a Kardashian baby daddy!</span></p><h2 id=ray-j-just-a-scorned-ex-lover><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Ray J: just a scorned ex lover</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>While there was a time when Ray J was better known than the Kardashians, a lot has changed since then. But it sounds like the rapper still has some harsh feelings about what went down between him and Kim before she was famous.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fans recognize Ray from the famous sex tape he made with Kim. You know, the one that catapulted her and her family into stardom. The two dated from 2003-2006, right before she got famous. Instead of taking the high road, the star has continued to bash his ex in the media following their break-up and her family’s increasing fame. It was just earlier this year that Ray insisted Kim cheated on him when they were together. “She was a player,” he said on Celebrity Big Brother. “We were both cheaters.”</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately, the public hasn’t been quick to sympathize with Ray J. Fans have accused him of just being fame-hungry, and bashing the Kardashians only to be relevant in the media for a second. Kim has said that Ray is just a blimp in her past, and refuses to talk about him (and most of her exes) now that she’s settled down with Kanye West. Kim has moved on, and so should you, Ray.</span></p><h2 id=ellen-pierson-the-money-hungry-stepmother><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Ellen Pierson: the money-hungry stepmother</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>For most kids, it’s hard when their parent remarries to someone else. But the Kardashian kids took it extremely hard when their father Robert Kardashian married Ellen Pierson, and the sketchy circumstances might have something to do with it. Ellen and Rob rushed to get married in July 2003 as he was fighting cancer at the time. The famous lawyer died only two months after their shotgun wedding. But the drama came afterwards.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Kardashian kids accused their new stepmother of only marrying their father in order to secure his fortune, and clearly they still feel the same way. Ellen released a tell-all book in 2013, which struck a nerve with the Kardashians. In the autobiography, Ellen says she wasn’t after Rob’s money and married him because she loved him. “You married him on his deathbed while he was not even aware of his surroundings,” Khloe tweeted after it was released. She also called Ellen an “evil stepmother” and said the family will “never forget.” Unsurprisingly, her siblings also have not had nice things to say about Ellen in the media. Yikes!</span></p><h2 id=damon-thomas-the-monster-from-kim-s-past><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Damon Thomas: the monster from Kim’s past</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Believe it or not, Kim Kardashian has been married a total of three times. Her first marriage happened when she was only 19. The star married R&B producer Damon Thomas, one half of the production duo The Underdogs, in a shotgun elopement. The couple were married for three years before Kim filed for divorce, citing physical and emotional abuse as the reason. They were legally divorced in 2004, and Kim had already started dating Ray J at that point.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Damon hasn’t kept quiet on his marriage to the high-profile celeb since then, even though it’s almost two decades in the past. In 2013, court documents from their divorce were leaked to the public, which said that Damon had been abusive. The music producer then gave a candid interview to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>In Touch </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>in order to give his side of the story. But he mostly used the opportunity to bash Kim, who he claims is fame-hungry and has had too much plastic surgery.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“She can’t write or sing or dance, so she does harmful things in order to validate herself in the media,” Damon said. “That’s someone who is fame hungry to me. It’s just not cool at all.” Kim has tried to remain classy when asked about her first hubby, but fans can all agree we’re glad this was one guy she dumped.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kris-humphries-the-other-half-of-the-72-day-marriage><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kris Humphries: the other half of the 72-day marriage</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>For a while, everyone thought that Kris Humphries and Kim Kardashian were meant to be. The couple celebrated their marriage with a lavish, televised wedding in which the reality star donned three different dresses. But their fairytale came to a crashing halt when they filed for divorced only 72 days later.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kim has tried to remain respectful when speaking about their short-lived marriage, saying she knew it wasn’t going to work out before they even tied the knot. But Kris has been a lot more vocal about Kim to the media, and not all he’s said has been pretty. Kris tried to drag his divorce with Kim out for the longest time. Though they were only together for a few months, their marriage lasted two years in total because of the legal drama. Kim was already pregnant with Kanye’s baby when their divorce was finalized.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Eventually, however, Kim successfully divorced Kris and didn’t have to give him the million-dollar payout he wanted. He’s still had nasty thing to say about his ex since then, but fans wish he’d just move on with his life, like Kim did.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=caitlyn-jenner-don-t-say-anything-bad-about-kris><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Caitlyn Jenner: don’t say anything bad about Kris</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Caitlyn Jenner was a huge part of the Kardashian Empire for many years. After all, she was married to Kris Jenner and is the father of Kylie and Kendall Jenner. Even after she and Kris divorced and she began her transition from a man to a woman, the Kardashian Klan seemed supportive of Caitlyn. That is until she released her tell-all book.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The former Olympian made a lot of startling accusations in the book, including saying Kris knew that she wanted to transition during their marriage. Cait definitely didn’t paint her ex wife in the best light in the book. As one would expect, the entire Kardashian family didn’t take well to Caitlyn’s attack on Kris, and they’re reportedly not on speaking terms with her now following the drama.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I went overboard to be nice, to be friendly, to be open, but also tell my story and my side of the story,” Caitlyn said this past September. “Since the book came out, I’ve never talked to Kris again. Kim, I haven’t talked to in six, nine months, whatever it is.” Clearly Cait should have thought twice before crossing the Kardashians.</span></p><h2 id=sofia-richie-she-chose-scott-over-everyone><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sofia Richie: she chose Scott over everyone</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sofia Richie has burned all bridges when it comes to her relationship with the Kardashians. As the daughter of Lionel Richie and younger sister of Nicole Richie, the starlet has grown up in the same social circle as the Kardashians. She used to be close with Kendall and Kylie while they were growing up, while Kim used to be friends with Nicole and her BFF Paris Hilton.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But now the Kardashians want nothing to do with Sofia since she began dating Scott Disick. Clearly Scott has a thing for teenage girls, since Sofia is 19 while he’s 34. Kourtney reportedly felt disgusted when the pair went public with their relationship, given Sofia’s young age and that she’s been a family friend for years.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sources say that the Kardashians will want nothing to do with the budding model once she and Scott break-up up (which, given his dating history, is a pretty for-sure thing). It doesn’t sound like Sofia will have a lot of close friends left in Hollywood if she keeps romancing the hallowed Lord Disick.</span></p><h2 id=karen-houghton-the-family-s-hidden-secret><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Karen Houghton: the family’s hidden secret</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Did you know Kris Jenner has a sister? Well, you probably didn’t since the matriarch likes to keep that fact very much hidden from the public. After years of troublesome behaviour, sources say that Kris and her family cut off all ties with her younger sister Karen Houghton, so as not to affect their famous images.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Karen reportedly has had a years-long struggle with substance abuse and is also known for dating unsavoury characters. Since Kris is obsessed with controlling her family’s picture-perfect image, she didn’t think her sister’s bad history would blow over well with the media, which is why she keeps her a secret.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>“While Karen is a totally down-to-earth sweetheart, she certainly doesn’t come close to meeting the glam standards that Kris likes to publicly project for her family,” a source once explained. “That’s also more than likely why you never see Karen on any of the family TV shows.” They added, “Karen means well, but bringing violent cons into their family circle has made her a bit of a black sheep – especially to Kris.” You have to keep your standards up if you want to be acknowledged by the Kardashians!</span></p><h2 id=chlo-grace-moretz-don-t-shame-kim-s-selfies><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Chloë Grace Moretz: don’t shame Kim’s selfies</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>There’s no denying that the Kardashians love to show off their bodies, but not everyone is a fan of it. And one of those people is actress Chloe Grace Moretz. The star was epically shut down by the Kardashian Klan after she criticized Kim for posing topless. "@KimKardashian I truly hope you realize how important setting goals are for young women, teaching them we have so much more to offer than just our bodies," Chloe tweeted at Kim after seeing one of her racy selfies.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, fans reacted to Chloe by saying she was slut-shaming Kim. Kim herself decided to respond by tweeting this burn: "Let's all welcome @ChloeGMoretz to twitter, since no one knows who she is. Your nylon cover is cute boo," she wrote. Chloe clapped back by sending some more harsh tweets Kim’s way, which prompted Khloe to post a photo of the actress having a nip slip while in a bathing suit, though it turned out to not be her. Some fans responded taking Chloe’s side, and saying the Kardashian sister was slut-shaming her, just as she’d originally done to Kim.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since then, the drama has seemingly dyed down. But we’d say the Kardashians definitely came out victorious in this Twitter tumble.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton-still-clinging-to-the-past><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Paris Hilton: still clinging to the past</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>There once was a time that Paris Hilton was the reigning queen of reality television, not the Kardashians. And, during this time, it just so happens that Kim was Paris’ close friend and seemingly lived in her shadows. In the early 2000s, Kim was often photographed partying with the blonde socialite, though no one knew who she was at the time. She was once even featured on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Simple Life, </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>when Paris ordered Kim to clean and organize her closet, and Kim happily obliged.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But since the Kardashians became a household name, they’ve tried to distance themselves from Paris Hilton, whose star power has been fading for a very long time. But Paris has tried to remind the public who really made Kim famous. Paris once Instagrammed a meme that said she made Kim famous, making it clear she takes responsibility for the Kardashian’s vast fame. However, Kim has tried her best to avoid the subject of Paris in the media. Paris really needs to take a hint and realize the Kardashians are out of her league nowadays.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lamar-odom-blames-them-for-all-of-his-problems><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lamar Odom: blames them for all of his problems</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Lamar Odom used to be a key figure on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Keeping Up With The Kardashians </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>back when he was married to Khloe K. The pair were married from 2009-2016, though they split up several years before their divorce was finalized. However, since their relationship fell apart, Lamar has tried to make it seem like the Kardashians are the ones to blame. But no one’s buying it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>While they were together, there were rumours about Lamar cheating on Khloe and abusing drugs. These fears were confirmed when the NBA star overdosed in a Nevada brothel. Though they were already estranged at the time, Khloe rushed to his side and nursed him back to health before going through with their divorce. Despite everything, Lamar has seemingly blamed the Kardashian Klan for his problems, and so has his family.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>“They don’t give a f*ck about my son. It’s more about the damage they do to the Kardashian brand. They brought him down. He’d be better off without them. Let him go, get his life together,” Lamar’s dad Joe previously said about his drama with the Kardashians. Lamar’s daughter has also said similar things to the media. However, many fans still think that Khloe was the one who got hurt the most during their troubled marriage.</span></p><h2 id=bette-midler-amp-pink-they-want-kim-to-cover-up><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Bette Midler & Pink: they want Kim to cover up</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Most people have an opinion on the Kardashians, even celebrities. But we bet Pink wished she would have just kept her mouth shut after she dissed Kim K, and her legion of loyal fans raced to her defense. Pink got herself in hot water back last fall after Kim posted another racy selfie, which caused quite the stir on social media. Singer Bette Midler first tweeted, "Kim Kardashian tweeted a nude selfie today. If Kim wants us to see a part of her we’ve never seen, she’s gonna have to swallow the camera." Kim quickly fired back, writing, "Hey @BetteMidler I know it’s past your bedtime but if you’re still up and reading this send nudes #justkidding."</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Pink then decided to get in on the drama, and she released a long message to her fans telling them to use their brains rather than bodies to make it in the world. "Shout out to all of the women, across the world, using their brains, their strength, their work ethic, their talent, their ‘magic’ that they were born with, that only they possess," she wrote. "It may not ever bring you as much ‘attention’ or bank notes as using your body, your sex, your t**s and a***s, but women like you don’t need that kind of ‘attention.’” Kardashian fans were quick to clap back accusing Pink of slut-shaming, and telling her to leave Kim alone. Clearly, the Kardashians won this Twitter war.</span></p><h2 id=robert-houghton-kris-jenner-s-dead-beat-dad><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Robert Houghton: Kris Jenner’s dead-beat dad</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Not a lot is known about the Kardashians before they became famous, including who Kris Jenner was before she began using the famous surname. It turns out that she had a pretty rough childhood, which explains why she never wants to talk about it. It turns out Kris’ father, Robert Houghton, was an abusive alcoholic who Kris desperately tried to get away from.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sources say Houghton was cruel towards his family while Kris was going up. His drinking was eventually the end of him as he died in a car accident after getting behind the wheel while impaired. “Bob had a lot of charm and was a great salesperson who could sell just about anything to anybody,” his ex girlfriend Leslie Johnson Leech once said to Star magazine.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“He was very entrepreneurial and had all kinds of ideas about ways to make a lot of money, but he rarely acted on them, possibly because of his drinking. But I can definitely see how Kris got her business drive from her dad,” she went on, adding he didn’t have a lot of contact with Kris and her kids when he passed. Clearly Kris didn’t want her abusive dad to have any of the perks that come from being related to a famous family, since she shut him out completely before his death.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-now-we-know-she-s-a-snake><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Taylor Swift: now we know she’s a snake</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Was there ever a time Taylor Swift was on good terms with the Kardashians? Her drama with the famous family began almost a decade ago when Kanye interrupted her acceptance speech at the VMAs to announce Beyoncé should have won. Since then, the two stars have been throwing jabs at one another in the media and their music. But things climaxed when Kanye released his hit “Famous,” in which he sings that Taylor and him might sleep together and that he made her famous.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Taylor was quick to announce that she felt offended by the song and believed it was anti-feminist. However, Kimye clapped back by saying that Tay had approved the song before it dropped, which the country singer continued to deny. However, Kim ended up shutting her down by releasing video footage of the call between Taylor and Kimye, where Taylor gives Kanye her permission to release the hit. This move completely shattered Taylor’s victim act, and now many fans have changed their opinion on her.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWTmrmmrtJmrqGnXZmus7HDZquoZZOnvLS%2FjK2fnmWblr%2BlrdKhoJqmo2Kur7CMoKatZaKqtq%2Bxw2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
