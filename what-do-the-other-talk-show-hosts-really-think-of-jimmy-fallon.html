These days the hosts are a little more civil with each other, and some are even complimentary. So what do other talk show hosts think of funny guy Fallon?</p><h2 id=stephen-colbert><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Stephen Colbert</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Longtime television host of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Stephen Colbert is known for his political acumen and bits on his show that prove it. Back in 2016, Fallon fell under fire for an interview he conducted with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Given his political knowledge, Colbert was asked his opinion. <a href=#>Colbert came to Fallon's defense saying</a> "you do not go to Jimmy Fallon's show for political satire or even political discussion," adding, "he's an entertainer and he's brilliant." High praise from Mr. Colbert.</p><h2 id=ellen-degeneres><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ellen DeGeneres</span></h2><p>Actress and comedian known for voicing Dory in Pixar films Finding Nemo and Finding Dory, <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a> is also the host of daytime talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which is going to end after its upcoming nineteenth season. DeGeneres has been friends with Fallon for a long time, and both hosts have appaeared on each other's shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jimmy Kimmel</span></h2><p>Late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel is often compared to Jimmy Fallon, partially because of their shared first name, but also because they're both hilarious late night hosts. Kimmel hosts Jimmy Kimmel Live! on ABC and is known for his sketches where celebrities read mean tweets about themselves and parents film themselves telling their children they ate all their Halloween candy. Given they regularly deliver funny late night content, and even kind of look alike, it's understandable why the two get mixed up. Kimmel <a href=#>has said</a> "My only complaint about Jimmy Fallon is the first name: Jimmy." Aside from his beef with Fallon's first name, Jimmy Kimmel thinks highly of his late night rival.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon Does Hilarious Impersonation Of Harry Styles And Fans Are Digging It</a></span></p><h2 id=conan-o-39-brien><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Conan O'Brien</span></h2><p>Former late night television host Conan O'Brien hosted his show Conan on TBS, but the iconic show ended its long run just months ago. Like Fallon, O'Brien also started his career at SNL, where he worked as a writer. Also like Fallon, O'Brien took over as host of The Tonight Show for Jay Leno for a brief period of time, but Jay Leno ended up coming back and replacing O'Brien. Jimmy Fallon later took over for Jay Leno when he offcially retired. Due to the controversy, O'Brien was naturally asked his thoughts on Jimmy Fallon taking over, and <a href=#>O'Brien had nothing but kind things to say</a>. "It's a fun gig," he said, and added, "Jimmy is the perfect guy to do it; he's going to do a fantastic job." Despite the dramatics, there is no bad blood between the two Tonight Show hosts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-clarkson><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kelly Clarkson</span></h2><p>Singer, songwriter, first ever winner of American Idol, and former coach of The Voice, <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a> has been hosting her own daytime talk show for a couple seasons now, and is slated to take over Ellen Degeneres's time slot after her final season. Clarkson has known Jimmy Fallon for years now as both have been household names in the entertainment industry since the early 2000s. Clarkson has appeared on Fallon's show several times throughout her career, even since the premier of her own show. Both are always happy to see each other, and often reminisce on stories from when they first met.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Leslie Mann Filmed Her Cat Making Dinner For Her Family And Shared It With Jimmy Fallon</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=seth-meyers><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Seth Meyers</span></h2><p>Comedian Seth Meyers also works at NBC as a late night television host, hosting Late Night with Seth Meyers after Fallon's block. Meyers is another late night talk show host who got his start at SNL. Meyers was head writer at the legendary sketch comedy show, and later followed in the footsteps of Fallon and where he became "Weekend Update" co-host alongside Amy Poehler, and later Cecily Strong until his departure. Fallon and Meyers have been friends for a long time, and when Fallon was under criticism due to his controversial Trump interview, his longtime friend came to his defense. The two also appear on each other's shows periodically.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon Just Proved He's The Biggest BTS Fan</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihoqWdrnqnrculpqdlopq5osDIqKWsoJmleri106FkqKyYmr9uuMCtnGammZy1tXnTmqOkZaOdvLh5x6iqratdpsKwwMSsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
