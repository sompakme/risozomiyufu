I’m human. I remember. Bog off.’”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Waddingham won an Emmy Award in 2021 for her breakout role playing AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Welton on <i>Ted Lasso</i>. The Apple TV+ comedy ran from 2020 to 2023 and costarred <strong>Jason Sudeikis</strong>, <strong>Juno Temple</strong>, <strong>Phil Dunster</strong> and <strong>Brett Goldstein</strong>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This year, Waddingham made a transition to movies&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>with a role opposite <strong>Ryan Gosling</strong> and <strong>Emily Blunt</strong> in The Fall Guy and voicing a character </span><span class=s1>in the animated <i>The Garfield Movie</i>. The London-born actor will also appear in the upcoming <i>Mission: Impossible 8</i> alongside <strong>Tom Cruise</strong>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While her Hollywood career has taken off, the road to screen stardom was not easy. Earlier this year, she <span class=s2><a href=#>recalled</a> to the “</span><a href=# rel=noopener>Michelle Visage’s Rule Breakers</a>” podcast, “I had one drama teacher that said to the whole class: ‘Oh, Hannah will never work on screen because she looks like one side of her face has had a stroke.’” Motivated to prove this teacher wrong, she thought, “Come hell or high water, I will work on screen.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Waddingham, a theater veteran, graced the stages of Broadway and London’s West End, earning acclaim for her work in <i>Spamalot</i> and <i>A Little Night Music</i>, among other shows. At the same time, she made minor appearances on TV.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“It got to the point where I realized I was only getting one scene in this, or one ep[isode] in that,” she said.&nbsp;“And I went, do you know what? I think I’ve done enough. … This isn’t cool any more. Why should I be constantly feeding into someone else’s storyline?”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She told her agents, “If it’s one scene, I’m not doing it any more, and you shouldn’t be putting me up for it because it’s insulting. I’ve been a leading lady for 22 years. I’m not doing it any more. I’d rather be in a world where I’m appreciated.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>When she stepped back, she was cast as Septa Unella in seasons 5 and 6 of the HBO fantasy drama <i>Game of Thrones</i>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Waddingham has no problem standing up for herself these days. In April, she <a href=#><span class=s2>scolded a photographer</span></a> who told her to “show leg” as she posed outside the Olivier Awards in London.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Oh, my God, you’d never say that to a man,” she said. “Don’t be a dick, otherwise I’ll move off.
