During a recent interview with Van Lathan‘s Higher Learning Podcast, the conversation between Lathan, 42, and Acho, 32, progressed into one about race,with the tone growing combative. 
A viral clip from the conversation began to make its rounds on social media last week, showing the former NFL star speaking about his experience as a Black person and claiming his Nigerian roots have barred him from generational issues and plight."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I don’t think that any of the things that they do are necessarily harmful, but what I could say, is a Black man, a prominent one, acting as an emotional butler for white people, and serving them the most milquetoast, un-spicy, unseasoned brand of racial discourse and accountability possible, could definitely be harmful. Like, we’re fighting for our lives, and to me, having a conversation like that, at that particular time, it’s not that it’s a different method. Everybody has a different method. It’s that it’s the wrong method.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Acho’s stance also garnered criticism from social media users, with some claiming he suggested, “he’s better equipped than Black Americans.” The Dallas, TX native hopped on Twitter to clarify his comments regarding his Nigerian ethnicity.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Van, the entire conversation was a public set up.
