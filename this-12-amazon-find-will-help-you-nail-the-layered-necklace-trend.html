Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, November 20, 2023, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This set includes two necklaces</a> which can be worn separately or together with endless styling possibilities. The first is a fourteen-inch paperclip chain choker with a two-inch extension to allow a comfortable fit around the neck. The other is an eighteen-inch, thin paperclip chain necklace with an embellished hexagon personalized pendant on one side and a heart engraved on the back for only you to feel against your skin like a warm embrace. “I like that it’s two different necklaces, so it’s optional if you just want to wear one or both!” said a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">happy shopper</a>, “It’s so beautiful! I would recommend it to anyone as a gift for themselves!”</p><p>You can choose to place the initials of a lover, child or friend on the front to feel close to them, create a conversation starter — or even place the first or last initial of your name on the front. Even <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kate Middleton</strong></a> has jumped on the trend, with three tiny pendants on a gold chain proudly displaying the first letters of her children’s names: Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis (without their titles, of course). It’s endearing and heartwarming to see her love on display.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">M MOOHAM Dainty Gold Necklace </span></a>for 20% off at Amazon right now — just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$12</a>!

These necklaces complement every skin tone and make excellent gifts. At this price, they would even make great stocking stuffers. Some buyers were wary that they would possibly tarnish over time but have found they have truly held up, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">saying</a>, “I love these necklaces; I’ve had mine forever. They don’t tarnish (I wear mine in the ocean, the shower, the gym, etc). Long lasting, good quality, and I’m amazed by the price,” while <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">another confirmed</a>, “I didn’t have high expectations but wow! It’s gorgeous, it has lasted a very long time without getting tarnished, and I always get compliments when I wear it.” You better hurry, the holidays are upon us — and this deal won’t last long.</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">M MOOHAM Dainty Gold Necklace </span></a>for 20% off at Amazon right now — just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$12</a>!
