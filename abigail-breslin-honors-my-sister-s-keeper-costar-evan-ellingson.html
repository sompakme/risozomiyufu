Some of his scenes in MSK still give me chills. He was also silly, funny, a prankster, a lover of Red Bull (I hated the smell of Red Bull 😂) and he was energetic and the life of the party.”</p><p>Breslin said that she and Ellingson “didn’t keep in touch a lot” after <a href=#>making the movie</a>, but she’s thought of him often in the years since. “He always stayed in my mind as a wonderful and sweet soul, one I am grateful to have crossed paths with,” she wrote. “My prayers and condolences are with his family at this difficult time.”</p><p>She ended her tribute with a direct message to Ellingson, writing: “Evan, I know Heaven will welcome you with open arms. Your time on this earth may have been, devastatingly, short. Your humor, exuberance, kindness and bright light will linger forever. Sending you peace on your journey to the great beyond and who knows … maybe one day, I’ll meet you in Montana.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Abigail-Breslin-Honors-My-Sisters-Keeper-Costar-Evan-Ellingson-After-His-Death-2.jpg><p>Breslin also added a postscript asking fans not to “speculate” on the circumstances of Ellingson’s death “out of respect for his family including his daughter.”</p><p>Ellingson was found dead in a bedroom at his home in Fontana, California, on Sunday, November 5, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department’s coroners division.
