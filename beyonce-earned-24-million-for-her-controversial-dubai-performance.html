Not only was the pop star decked out in millions of dollars in jewelry and accompanied by a full stage of performers, but the concert ended with a lavish fireworks display.</p><p>Atlantis The Royal Hotel is now one of Dubai’s most luxurious hotels. It has over 700 rooms, and a variety of lavish features, including the world’s largest jellyfish aquarium. It also has 17 restaurants and bars for guests to enjoy.</p><p>Beyonce didn’t only receive huge compensation for the performance; she was also treated like royalty and put up in one of the hotel’s most luxurious penthouses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With over 12,000 square feet of living space, the <a href=#>penthouse rents for $100,000 per night</a>. It can accommodate 9 people, and features 4 bedrooms, each fitted with King and Queen sized beds.</p><p>Not only do guests staying in the penthouse have access to 24-hour room and butler services, but they can also have spa services done inside their room, including a portable steam room.</p><p>However, one of the reasons Beyonce was likely paid so well was because of the controversy surrounding her performance.</p><p>As soon as the concert was announced, critics slammed Bey for choosing to perform in the country given its strict stand on women and LGBTQ+ rights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, as <a href=#>The Guardian</a> points out, Beyonce failed to perform any songs from her latest album Renaissance. It’s speculated this is because the album is interpreted to have many references to the Black and Queer community.</p><p>Nonetheless, the pop star never directly commented on the controversy.</p><p>Beyonce isn’t the only singer to receive a million-dollar paycheck for a single performance, though hers may have been the costliest. In 2022, billionaire David Bonderman paid the Rolling Stone $18.7 million to perform for his 60th birthday party.</p><p>More recently, Christina Aguilera earned $6 million to sing at Andrei Melnichenko’s 2007 wedding in France, while the Eagles got $6 million to play a single song (“Hotel California” during a private New York City party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Donald Trump Fined Almost $1 Million For Suing Hillary Clinton</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Forbes</a>, <a href=#>The Guardian</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvpsXOp5qeZZWWv6%2Bxw2ZpbWWdnrmttc6nZJ%2BnomK1pr6MnKanrKKkw6a%2B0qKYpWWUqq%2BitYypnKuen6e6orrCnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
