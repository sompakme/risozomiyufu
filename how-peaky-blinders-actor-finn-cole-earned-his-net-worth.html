At the age of 26 years old, Cole has starred in his own television series and been a part of one of the best TV shows of the last decade. His brother, Joe Cole, who played John Shelby on Peaky Blinders, helped Finn land the role of Michael Gray on the show. Finn Cole nowhas an estimated net worth of $2 million, which is a number that will likely grow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Cillian Murphy Elevated His Career After Landing His Iconic 'Peaky Blinders' Role</a></span></p><p>Finn Cole is an English actor who was born on November 9th, 1995 in Kingston, London. Cole went to Esther College and wanted to work on boats like his father. However, he began acting a decade ago, and it's clear that this is the path he was meant to take. If Finn Cole was busy sailing the seas, fans would have never gotten to meet J Cody or Michael Gray.</p><h2 id=finn-cole-39-s-start-in-acting><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Finn Cole's Start In Acting</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2012, Finn Cole got his start by playing an extra in his brother's film Offender. Two years later, Joe Cole aided his little brother in landing the role of Michael Gray on Peaky Blinders. This role put him in a great position in his career at a very young age. The following year, Finn appeared as Eric Birling in the BBC One adaptation of An Inspector Calls. Cole went on to play Ollie Tedman in a few episodes of a British detective television series called Lewis. Then, in 2016, Finn Cole began starring as Joshua "J" Cody in TNT's Animal Kingdom. The series is currently gearing up for its sixth and final season. During his run on both Peaky Blinders and Animal Kingdom, Cole appeared in many films as well, including Slaughterhouse Rulez (where he played Don Wallace), Dreamland (where he played Eugene Evans), Here Are the Young Men (where he played Joseph Kearney), and F9, (where he played a young Jakob Toretto).</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody></tbody></table><h2 id=finn-cole-joins-39-peaky-blinders-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Finn Cole Joins 'Peaky Blinders'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finn Cole may have missed out on season one of this breakout series, but his presence was made apparent in season two. As we all know, his brother's character, John Shelby, did not make it past season four after he was shot and killed in the opening episode. Many characters have come and gone from the series, but Finn Cole's Michael Gray is still going strong. This show definitely put Finn Cole on the map.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Peaky Blinders’ Is Back After Major Challenges, Reveals Director Anthony Byrne</a></span></p><h2 id=finn-cole-plays-michael-gray><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Finn Cole Plays Michael Gray</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here is a character rundown for Finn Cole's Peaky Blinders character, Michael Gray, from Cheatsheet. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Gray... eventually becomes the Chief Accountant</a> of Shelby Company Limited. He helps expand the business to America and works in New York for a time, where he meets his wife, Gina Gray. In season 5, Michael plots to take over the business with Gina.

Michael will likely become the enemy in season 6."</p><p>It will be interesting to see what happens to Michael in the sixth and final season of the series.</p><h2 id=finn-cole-stars-on-39-animal-kingdom-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Finn Cole Stars On 'Animal Kingdom'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Landing another main character role in another popular series is very impressive. On Animal Kingdom, Finn Cole plays the nephew of brothers Craig (Ben Robson), Baz (Scott Speedman), Deran (Jake Weary), and Pope (Shawn Hatosy). His grandmother, Janine "Smurf" Cody, is played by award-winning actress, Ellen Barkin. Cole began on this show six years ago and has stuck on it ever since. Multiple main characters have been killed off (including some actors listed here), but not Finn Cole though!</p><h2 id=finn-cole-plays-j-cody><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Finn Cole Plays J Cody</span></h2><p>Joshua "J" Cody went to seek refuge with his grandmother after his mother died of an overdose. Little did he know that he would be joining a family of robbers and criminals. J was a little hesitant at first, but he eventually joined his uncles. At just seventeen years old, J began to run the family business, and with power comes responsibility.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Margot Robbie Changes Hair To Red In 'Babylon' And Looks Unrecognizable</a></span></p><h2 id=finn-cole-stars-in-39-dreamland-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Finn Cole Stars In 'Dreamland'</span></h2><p>Finn Cole is taking it up a notch after starring in the thriller, <a href=#>Dreamland, alongside Margot Robbie</a>.

[This film] represented a big step forward for the actor, who gets top billing in a movie alongside an Oscar-nominated star.

"When I was on the train going in for my audition in London to meet Margot, I was very nervous. I had prepared as much as I could, but I worried I was going to forget the lines. That’s credit to how impressive I thought Margot was because I don’t usually get like that. As soon as she walked into the room, and we got to know each other, that immediately dropped. She’s got a welcoming personality and from day one I felt like we were collaborating together. She listened to everything I had to say. I learned so much from her.
