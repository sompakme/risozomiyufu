Some of which were confirmations to long-running speculations, while some were new revelations. Not all have been dark, though — like Doja Cat's confession that <a href=#>she lip-synced her Billboard Music Awards performance</a>. Then there are the occasional conspiracy theories such as <a href=#>that one about Kendall Jenner's 818 Tequila</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But TikTokers definitely cover all sorts of exposé. For instance, a YouTuber recently did a TikTok proving that Jane the Virgin grabbed an audio clip from her YouTube video without permission. And it's not looking good for <a href=#>the hit CW series</a>. Netizens were quick to call for justice, saying that the creator should have been credited or paid.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Jane The Virgin': Who Is Ivonne Coll, TV's Favorite On-Screen Grandma?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-scene-in-question>The Scene In Question</h2><p>In the season 1 finale of Jane the Virgin, Gina Rodriguez's character, Jane Villanueva finally gives birth. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture described the episode</a> as "modulated remarkably well." It certainly left fans intrigued about what the next season would be like. "That moment and the birthing afterglow that follows is, without question, one of the most glorious moments the TV season will produce this year," wrote Libby Hill. "Full of pure, beautiful emotion, and the closest thing to joy that fiction is able to provide."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hill added that the realistic portrayal of giving birth "is precisely what makes the final scene of 'Chapter Twenty-Two' so monstrous." The critic also raved about the well-written, very-soap-opera kidnapping plot. "All of the other plots are wholly in line with what you’d expect on a big season finale," she wrote. "Even a kidnapping isn’t so shocking on a run-of-the mill soap opera... But Mateo isn’t just a child, he’s a catalyst. He’s the reason the entire show exists. He is the true love and entire world of a character who we, as an audience, love more than life itself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to say that Jane is a "role model" and "the best of what humanity is capable of while still remaining flawed and interesting and complicated." Unfortunately, that message probably doesn't resonate with fans of YouTuber Jessica Skube (AKA JesssFam) after finding out that her scream was used without her permission for Jane's labor scene.</p><h2 id=the-tea>The Tea</h2><p>In the first part of the TikTok video captioned "Story time & proof from when popular TV show Jane the Virgin used MY audio without me knowing," Skube green-screened her 2012 YouTube video titled, "Natural Unmedicated Twin Labor & Delivery!" <strong>The 32-minute clip has over 4 million views.</strong> "Still the most intense labor and delivery vlog to this day 8 years later," a fan wrote in the comments. The mini-documentary shows raw footage of Skube's journey to giving birth to her twins, Kyson and Kaden. "This was probably the hardest and most rewarding thing I'll ever do in my entire life and I'm lucky enough to have it all on video," the mom of five wrote in the caption.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The video also covers her delivery — screams and everything. And as it turned out, a part of her scream sounded exactly like the one in Jane the Virgin's labor scene. In the TikTok video, Skube repeatedly played the separate clips, individually and simultaneously. <strong>It's hard to ignore the evidence suggesting that the content creator's audio was indeed used by the CW series.</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jared Padalecki Reflects On Acting After 'Supernatural' With New Role In The CW's 'Walker'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They cant keep getting away with this smh," a fan wrote in the comments of the reposted TikTok. "Defo pursue this as you are meant to give consent, they give you credit and also money for "your part" and the fact they used a real birth clip in that way [as well] is messed up!" A lot of fans urged the YouTuber to sue or "get that bag." One said that "the t&cs of uploading a video to YouTube probably strips you of a lot of rights/intellectual property etc."</p><p>Some naysayers argued that Skube's video is "online with no copyright warning so they therefore can use [it]." But a few netizens fall in between the whole issue. One wrote: "Idk, I mean if your YouTube is public....? But they should have at least put your name in the credits lol." Skube found out about it when her fans sent her a message about the season 1 finale when it aired in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 2017 vlog, she said she had no idea how production got it and that she was never asked for permission. "I don't know if that's even legal," she said. "I'm assuming it's not legal but I don't know what to do about that. I honestly think it was pretty cool. It would have been nice if they gave me a heads up, you know." Jane the Virgin hasn't issued a statement.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>'Batwoman’: Ruby Rose Threatened By The CW To Work 10 Days After Breaking Her Neck</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqaVYsGpsYyvoKufmaN6rrXGoatmoJGrsm6%2F06ijnqZdlrturdSdoKhllqe8rnnToaCsZamkwrXBwZ6paA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
