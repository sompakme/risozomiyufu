Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine. But we as a society, must do better. People in positions of influence and power must do better. And to any trans woman out there feeling inadequate as a woman, keep strutting honey.”</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>After Morgan and Medley’s offensive remarks, fans took to the comments sections of the <i>RHONY</i> stars’ Instagram accounts to express their disappointment.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Transphobic isn’t cute,” one user commented on Morgan’s<a href=#> <span class=s2>Instagram</span></a> photo at the Garo Sparo show.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Another added, “You should be calling the ‘guys’ on the runway queens or dolls.”</span></p><p>In a statement to&nbsp;Us on Wednesday, September 11, Morgan and Medley apologized, saying, “We have a history as long-standing supporters of the LGBTQ community in many ways and apologize for our offensive comments at the fashion show.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGjwKixzZ2cq2WdpLGmuIyrnKyon6OxtHnTqGSbnZmjtG6wyKyqnpxdl8Zuv86noZplnaS%2FqK3NZpuoqpmjsaJ5zJ6bpZ2pZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
