There’s no denying that Selena Gomez has taken the beauty industry by storm with her bestselling makeup brand Rare Beauty. However, the star still relies on other affordable brands to keep her skin looking bouncy and glowing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, the star still relies on other affordable brands to keep her skin looking bouncy and glowing. While she has access to some of the most luxurious facial moisturizers and serums on the market, Gomez keeps things low-key with products you can find at the local drugstore and Amazon. How do we know this? She gave us all a little peek into her skincare routine in a “Get Ready With Me” <a href=#>TikTok video</a> last year.</p><p>While Gomez showcased an array of skincare goodies in the clip, we were drawn to eye cream she used because of its convenient tip applicator. Many eye creams come in a pot that you have to dip your fingers into, which can get unsanitary pretty quickly. The product Gomez used, on the other hand, allowed her to apply the cream exactly where she wanted to — talk about a simple innovation! After doing some digging, we discovered it was the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Eye Gel Cream</a>.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Eye Gel Cream</a> at Amazon!</strong></p><p>Now, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Eye Gel Cream</a> offers so much more than just ingenious packaging. What’s inside the tube happens to be a youthful cocktail for your eye area. The brand utilizes the power of grapes (fancy) to craft all of its formulas, including this eye cream. The star ingredient, Resveratrol, is actually extracted from grape vines and helps to visibly firm and lift the area as well as reduce the look of wrinkles. Isn’t that cool?</p><p>The eye cream doesn’t just address signs of aging, though. It also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">helps to depuff the eye area</a>, and keep it well hydrated, soft and supple thanks to hyaluronic acid and quinoa extract. For being able to do so much, the cream doesn’t feel unbearably heavy on skin. It has a nice silky gel-cream texture which seamlessly melts into the delicate eye area and layers beautifully with other skincare products.</p><p>Gomez isn’t the only fan of this eye cream either. Hundreds of Amazon shoppers can’t get enough of it because of how gentle it is, even for those with sensitive skin. “I have tried out many eye creams over the years and consider myself to be pretty picky. I have very sensitive skin and am always worried about potential reactions when using ingredients like hyaluronic acid, but had no issues at all with this product,” explains <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one happy customer</a>. “I love that it absorbs quickly but I can still feel it’s there. I have crows feet and can already see a visible difference in their appearance from using this. I also LOVE that this product is clean and supports sustainable packaging. This is something that is near impossible to find these days, a product with little environmental impact that actually works. So happy I found this one!”</p><p>Fair warning: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This could become your new go-to eye cream</a>, but you won’t know until you try it out.
