I was listening to Jessi Colter and Waylon Jennings at the time me and mom saw them and pulled over to pick them up.”</p><p>Lambert continued, “I took them straight to the vet and she told me that the little boy was not doing too well (malnourished and dehydrated ) because whatever they had found to eat while they were homeless, he always let her eat first. He did that nearly his whole life. She said he probably wouldn’t make it but he did. For almost 13 years.”</p><p>The Grammy winner added that she considered Waylon a “rock” for her family, adding that she was “thankful” her husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Brendan McLoughlin</strong></a>, was able to spend time with him before he died.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He was a farm dog through and through and retired to Nashville life riding on the bus with mama to go home to Texas for Christmas every year,” she wrote. “I’m so thankful for the time we had with him and I’m thankful for the rest of the time we have with his sister Jessi.
