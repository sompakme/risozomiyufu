After 25 episodes of the original show, plus countless spinoffs, movies, and music videos, though, Bam fell out of favor in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His current net worth <a href=#>has dropped well below the $45 million</a> it once was, and Margera has plenty of other troubles apart from losing cash. He's since been fired from the 'Jackass' franchise, and fans really <a href=#>aren't impressed with his recent "bad behavior."</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts To Bam Margera Suing ‘Jackass’ Over His Firing</a></span></p><p>The thing is, just because he's been cut off from the franchise that made him famous doesn't mean Bam is completely out of the game. He has other revenue streams that may not be cut off by the firing, even though it could take some time to build his net worth back (if he's ever able to do so at all).</p><h2 id=how-much-did-bam-margera-make-from-mtv>How Much Did Bam Margera Make From MTV?</h2><p>Bam started out on MTV more than a decade ago, and he had two series ('Jackass' and later 'Viva La Bam') that helped pad his pockets. In fact, with how high the budgets were reported to be for both of Bam's shows, it's not surprising that he was raking in millions per season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn't just those two series, though.</p><p>Viewers will recall that apart from his comedy skills, Bam also has some skateboarding chops. That meant he earned cash from sponsorships and additional skateboarding-related opportunities.</p><h2 id=bam-made-money-from-his-skateboarding-skills>Bam Made Money From His Skateboarding Skills</h2><p>Fans know that Bam is closely tied to Tony Hawk's brand and that his likeness has appeared in various iterations of Tony Hawk video games. In fact, he's been in eight video games altogether, seven of which were Tony Hawk ones.</p><p>What's more, Bam also benefited financially from sponsorships related to skateboarding. While the now 41-year-old has lost out on some opportunities because of his aforementioned 'bad behavior' over the years, that cash flow helped boost Bam's worth to the point where losing $25M didn't really hurt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brands like Toy Machine Skateboards started sponsoring Bam all the way back in the '90s, but he would also partner with bigger brands like Element Skateboards, Volcom, and others.</p><p>At first, Margera was on the Element demonstration team, but that fizzled out as of 2016. Yet the company also produced BAM decks, which Margera later referred to when discussing whether Element would support him if he wasn't able to prove his sobriety.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, in an interview a few years ago, Bam <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">elaborated</a> that although Element would send him "20 [decks] for free every month," he'd go buy his own because of how often he moved around.</p><p>He laughed, "It was just easier to do that than waiting 10 days for a[n] Element box to hopefully show up at an address that I didn’t know yet. I didn’t know where I was going."</p><p>But although his sponsorships were lucrative, they may not have been his biggest windfall. In fact, Bam once stated that because he was "basically the main character" in 'Tony Hawk's Underground 2,' he got a big piece of the sales cut.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bam Margera Reveals His Infected Tattoo After Forgetting To Clean It</a></span></p><p>So how much was that game appearance worth? Margera claimed to have bought a Ferrari Modena "because of that," so fans can do the math. That was, of course, after he became "good friends" with Tony Hawk -- which led to countless other game appearances and, of course, cash flow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=margera-is-also-a-producer-director>Margera Is Also A Producer/Director</h2><p>Admittedly, most of Bam Margera's projects as a producer and/or director were related to the 'Jackass' franchise. But he's worked on various other projects behind the camera, too.</p><p>His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb resume</a> includes everything from cinematography on music videos to directing documentary shorts.</p><p>Plus, Bam even founded his own music label a while back, which meant he directed music videos for various bands and musicians. He's also been a part of various bands himself over the years, though it seems not all of his musical ventures pan out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-bam-still-have-money-coming-in>Does Bam Still Have Money Coming In?</h2><p>Though he hasn't expressly told fans that he's still raking in the dough, it would seem that Bam Margera is still making money from various sources. While he apparently won't have any future income from 'Jackass' coming in, there is the matter of royalties for his films, TV shows, and video game appearances.</p><p>His music production business also seems to be going well, judging by Bam's Instagram shares. Plus, Bam's now working on various documentaries (including one about his life), so he's not completely left Hollywood even though physically, he often migrates around the globe (he got married to his current wife in Iceland!).</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Fans Encourage Bam Margera To Share More Wholesome Posts After Drunken Rant</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilqKxdlrmtec6fZJuZnWK6or7Gnqmaq12jsrV51qipraBdmK6usYyfqailXZ22tHnTr2SfmZ2afA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
