Personalized name necklaces first took off in the ‘80s but have managed to make comebacks over and over again in the decades since. At this point, we think it’s safe to assume that they’ll be around for a long, long time, cementing themselves as a staple in our jewelry box and around our neck."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At this point, we think it’s safe to assume that they’ll be around for a long, long time, cementing themselves as a staple in our jewelry box and around our neck.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jewlr’s Personalized Name Necklace</a> reminds us of the necklace fashion icon Carrie Bradshaw (<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Jessica Parker</a></strong>) wore on Sex and the City. When we secure the lobster clasp around our neck, we’ll feel like we’re ready to write our own column for The New York Star, but instead of writing about Mr. Big or Aidan, we’re just going to keep writing about this necklace. Shall we put on a tutu and make ourselves a Cosmopolitan?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chelsea-Necklace.jpg><p><strong>See it: Make your own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Personalized Name Necklace</a> (originally $129) starting at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$49</a> — 62% Off!</strong></p><p>Apart from Carrie, real-life celebs have also rocked this trend to show us how it’s done. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a></strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Conrad</a></strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Adele</strong></a> and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna</a></strong> are just a few fabulous examples. We’re ready to add our own names to that list, but first, we need to customize our necklace on Jewlr.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Customization</a> is super simple and straightforward, but offers plenty of options so we can have something unique and meant either just for us or the person we’re gifting it to. To start, we can enter any name or text that’s nine characters or fewer and watch as the photo transforms to show us just what our necklace will look like. We can type our own name, or get more creative.</p><p>Did someone just have a baby? We can get them <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a necklace</a> that says “Mom.” We can <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> our own mothers that, too! Is someone getting married and changing their last name? Reflect that in this personalized gift. We could even make our own friendship necklaces by customizing one to say “Best” and another to say “Friends.” Whatever we want, all we have to do is type it in!</p><p>We can also choose among 12 fonts for whichever word or name we enter. After that, we move on to choosing our preferred metal. We have seven choices of all types of silver and gold, ranging from sterling silver, to 10K and 14K white, yellow and rose golds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bestie-necklace.jpg><p>The simplicity of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">personalized name necklace</a> is already excellent in its minimalism, but this is our customization, right? That means if we want to add an accent charm, we can! In fact, there are 20 charm options we can choose from. We can pick out a heart charm or stone to show some love, a dog or cat for an animal lover in our life (a.k.a. Us), or a little girl or boy charm for a parent, among many others!</p><p>If we choose a stone option for our charm, there are loads of colors to pick from. If we want one round stone, there are 20 genuine stone options, 17 simulated options and 12 Swarovski zirconia options in every color of the rainbow and beyond. We can also choose two round stones and get two different ones! The heart stones come in singles and doubles as well!</p><p>After our charm situation is settled, we can pick among chain lengths and types, which differ depending on the metal of our necklace. There are rope, cable and diamond-cut chains, ranging from 14 inches to 24 inches. This way, we can buy a shorter necklace and layer it with a longer one!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Our necklace</a> automatically comes with a classic black necklace folder, but if we want to further customize, we can get a box featuring our own photo, message or illustration! Both of these options are currently on sale too!</p><p>This necklace is already on sale, but while Jewlr’s winter sale is still going, we can use the WINTER2019 code for an even bigger discount. We can save up to 50% off throughout the site with this code on select jewelry! This seems like a good time for us to finally buy a necklace that says “Shopping” with a double-heart charm hanging beneath it. We’re not shy about our one, true love.</p><p><strong>See it: Make your own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Personalized Name Necklace</a> (originally $129) starting at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$49</a> — 62% Off!</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?
