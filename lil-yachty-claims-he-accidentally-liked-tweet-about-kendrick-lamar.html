Lil Yachty claims that he did not intend to link a tweet where a Drake fan account called out Kendrick Lamar for infidelity.
The Compton, Calif., rapper released his Drake-targeted diss record “Euphoria” on Tuesday (April 30) and called out the Toronto superstar for being a “deadbeat” father. Naturally, fans of the “Rich Baby Daddy” rapper weren’t pleased with the claim and recalled an admission he made on his 2022 album Mr."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Naturally, fans of the “Rich Baby Daddy” rapper weren’t pleased with the claim and recalled an admission he made on his <a href=#>2022 album</a> Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On the song “Worldwide Steppers,” he rapped, “The first time I f**ked a white b**ch, I was sixteen at the Palisades, fumblin’ my grades,” and “Next time I f**ked a white b**ch, was out in Copenhagen/ Good Kid, M.A.A.D City tour, I flourished on them stages.” He mentioned a conversation he had with his wife, Whitney Alford, about the situation as well: “Whitney asked did I have a problem/ I said, ‘I might be racist’/ Ancestors watchin’ me f**k was like retaliation.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On “Mother I Sober,” Kendrick confirmed that he cheated on his wife, though he did not specifically say that it was with white women. “Intoxicated, there’s a lustful nature that I failed to mention/ Insecurities that I project, sleepin’ with other women/ Whitney’s hurt, the pure soul I know, I found her in the kitchen/ Askin’ God, ‘Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A Drake fan account posted a Genius lyric card from Kendrick Lamar’s “Euphoria” where he raps, “Y’all think all of my life is rap?/ That’s h** sh*t, I got a son to raise, but I can see you know nothin’ bout that.” In the caption, they asked, “So who was raising your child while you were out cheating on your wife with white women? @kendricklamar.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">These days, a large part of being a Hip-Hop fan is perusing artists’ social media activity. So, unsurprisingly, a music account discovered that Lil Yachty liked the tweet alluding to K. Dot’s infidelity. The act was perceived as him subtly going to bat for the Toronto superstar, with whom he has <a href=#>collaborated </a>and developed a strong friendship over the last few years. Beyond that, Yachty himself was mentioned in “Euphoria” with the lines: “I’m allergic to the lame sh*t, only you like bein’ famous/ Yachty can’t give you no swag neither, I don’t give a f**k ’bout who you hang with.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Lil Boat cleared the air hours later, writing, “Sh*t was an accident lmao.” A fan responded to his tweet with a video saying, “There’s no way out of this one…you’re done” and wrote “Too late buddy” in the caption. The Atlanta rapper quoted the tweet and added multiple laughing emojis.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Euphoria” was Kendrick Lamar’s response to Drake’s one-two punch of “<a href=#>Push Ups</a>” and the <a href=#>now-deleted</a> “<a href=#>Taylor Made Freestyle</a>,” the latter of which featured modulated vocals from Tupac and Snoop Dogg. K. Dot kicked off this chapter of his feud with his former collaborator on <a href=#>Future and Metro Boomin’s</a> “<a href=#>Like That</a>” at the end of March.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6G2rXnYmpqhrKliuaq3xJ1kra%2BVmsFut8Snm6uhk6B6ra3MmqlmmZOYtqWxza1kq52jpbyvv8RmaGtrZG2EdYSVbGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
