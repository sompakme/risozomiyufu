She added new stops to her amazing Eras tour, and fans can enjoy her <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>in movie theaters across North America. Of course, no matter how much career success she has, no one will ever stop discussing who she's dating and whether things are getting serious.</p><p>While <a href=#>fans could tell that Matty Healy and Swift wouldn't last</a>, many are hopeful that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce will make it. The singer's new romance has made everyone wonder if she is ever going to get married. Taylor Swift's fans have always been curious about how she feels about settling down with someone, and she has talked about the subject quite a lot.</p><h2 id=does-taylor-swift-actually-want-to-get-married>Does Taylor Swift Actually Want To Get Married?</h2><p>Over the past ten years or so, Taylor Swift has answered questions about whether she is interested in marriage. In 2010, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the singer talked about marriage</a> in an interview with Us Weekly (via MTV News).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Swift was only 21 years old. She said, "Not really. Not as far as anything in the immediate or general future. I'm not opposed to it. I just don't think about it! I don't focus on pining away for love, because I'm focused on being happy with what's happening right now."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-10t173733-797.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift And Her Team Banned A Major TV Network's Request To Play Her Music, And It Was All Because Of Travis Kelce</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's team was quick to deny FOX access for her music given the reasoning for its usage.</span><p>Of course, that wasn't the only time that the beloved singer discussed the topic. In 2013, Swift was interviewed by Wonderland Magazine and said once again that she wasn't thinking that far ahead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift.jpg><p>Swift said:</p><p>"I have no idea if I’m going to get married or be single forever or have a family or just be on my own. You know, paint in a cottage by the ocean by myself... Relationships are like traffic lights. And I just have this theory that I can only exist in a relationship if it’s a green light."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, one year earlier, Swift said something completely different. In 2012, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift talked about children and marriage</a> in an interview with Cosmopolitan (via The Hollywood Reporter).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/imitating-taylor-swift-s-eras-tour-outfits-would-cost-fans-an-absolute-fortune.jpg><p>She said, “Being a mom full-time, doing everything for my kids, having a bunch of them. One day, I’m sure.“</p><p>While Taylor Swift doesn't seem to have commented on the subject in the last few years, fans did wonder if she and Joe Alwyn were going to tie the knot. After all, they were together for six years, and this was her longest romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Who Has Taylor Swift Dated In 2023?</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Joe Alwyn (broke up spring 2023)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Matty Healy (May-June 2023)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Travis Kelce (currently)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>When Swift released her "Midnights" album in October 2022, fans were immediately drawn to the lyrics to the opening song, "Lavender Haze."</p><p>Swift mentioned all the chatter about whether she and Alywn would get engaged in the lyrics: "All they keep askin' me/Is if I'm gonna be your bride/The only kind of girl they see/Is a one-night or a wife."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fans-applauded-the-way-taylor-swift-saved-dave-grohl-and-paul-mccartney-s-party-front-deposite-back-youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Applauded The Way Taylor Swift Saved Dave Grohl At Paul McCartney's Party</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift stepped in after Dave Grohl was put in an awkward situation with Paul McCartney.</span><p>Even though <strong>Swift and Alwyn broke up in April 2023</strong>, a source told Entertainment Tonight in 2020 that she did consider committing to him legally.
