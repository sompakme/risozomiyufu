The two first began on Vine back when the six-second video app was popular, and later shifted their following over to YouTuber.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The&nbsp;pair currently&nbsp;has a whopping 11 million subscribers on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>&nbsp;and share a combined total of over 15 million followers on their social media accounts. It's safe to say that the two are racking in the big bucks from video views, sponsorships, and endorsements, which have made their impressive $5 million net worth possible.</p><p>Considering they are only 20-years-old, the two have found ways to spend their millions in both responsible and not-so-responsible ways. From lavish cars&nbsp;to homes, and designer filled wardrobes, the Dolan Twins are certainly living their best lives. Here is just about everything these two spend their money on!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=private-fitness-centre><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Private Fitness Centre</span></h2><p>If there is one thing that the Dolan Twins are known for, it is their physique. The duo hit the gym quite often and take fitness extremely seriously. They have always been known for their chiselled features and rock hard abs, which have come with a lot of hard work. After collaborating with makeup mogul and fellow YouTuber, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffree Star, </a>the twin's transformed Star into one of them, which meant intense workout sessions in their very own private fitness centre. The twin's workout in quite a fancy facility with just about every machine, weight and equipment needed to stay in shape.</p><h2 id=their-very-first-los-angeles-home><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Their Very First Los Angeles Home</span></h2><p>The Dolan Twins have easily become some of the most famous YouTubers and social media influencers to date. After having first started off on the app, Vine, both Ethan and Grayson Dolan have managed to create an even bigger following online that has allowed them to make a lot of money! The duo went ahead and purchased their first-ever home together back in 2019. The Dolan Twins purchased a $2.15 million home in Encino, which is in the San Fernando Valley just outside Los Angeles, California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-their-first-mobile-home><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>And Their First Mobile Home</span></h2><p>In addition to buying their first home, the duo also went ahead and built their very own mobile home! The Dolan Twins ventured off across the country last year for a coast to coast road trip in a van that they themselves flipped into a portable home. While it certainly does not come with all the bells and whistles their Los Angeles mansion has, it certainly did the trick! Both Ethan and Grayson built the interior of the van, which in addition to the van itself, cost quite a pretty penny.</p><h2 id=skateboard-collection><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Skateboard Collection</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>8 </span><span></span></h2><p>If there is one pass time that both Ethan and Grayson enjoy, it is skateboarding. While neither twin claims to have the skills of Tony Hawk, they still enjoy the relaxing mornings they take to the skatepark where they attempt certain trick shots and moves that oftentimes lead them to fall on their face. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan had tweeted out </a>that he had once tried to do a trick shot in front of some "cuties", as he put it, but only found himself falling to the ground! Despite not being professional boarders, the two enjoy top of the line skateboards and have quite the collection!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travel-travel-amp-more-travel><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Travel, Travel & More Travel</span></h2><p>Although the Dolan Twins find themselves travelling quite a bit for work, whether they are attending Paris Fashion Week, a conference or are a part of a brand trip, the two also find time to travel for leisure as well. The two not only enjoy a trip or two to Vegas every now and again but the also reserved a lot of time from last year to step away from YouTube and the spotlight to enjoy a cross country road trip. Both Ethan and Dolan are also known for heading to Europe now and again alongside friend Emma Chamberlain, and they definitely travel in luxury.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">25 Things Professional Youtubers Aren't Allowed To Do</a></span></p><h2 id=all-on-a-private-jet><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>All On A Private Jet</span></h2><p>As mentioned, The Dolan Twins travel in luxury! While they have travelled in the back of a mobile home that they themselves built, the two are also known for keeping things very luxe and fancy! If they are flying to Las Vegas, New York City or are heading over to Paris, you bet they are doing it in style. The twins have found themselves on board a private jet more times than many of us will ever see in our lifetime, and it is safe to say we are definitely a little bit jealous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Of The Things Jeffree Star Spends His Millions On</a></span></p><h2 id=luxury-car-collection><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Luxury Car Collection</span></h2><p>In addition to Ethan and Grayson Dolan's custom van they purchased and built into a mini home for their cross country adventures, the duo also has a few other luxe cars. Ethan was able to fulfill his life long dream of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purchasing a vintage 1960's custom Bronco</a>, and Greyson snagged himself a baby blue Lamborgini, making their car collection not only impressive but extremely expensive too. However, when you are worth millions of dollars, what is a $250,000 car really?</p><h2 id=designer-clothes-amp-accessories><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Designer Clothes & Accessories</span></h2><p>As if the cars in their garage weren't nice enough, the clothes in their closets are even nicer! While they aren't&nbsp;the biggest hype beasts out there buying designer clothes and accessories left and right, they certainly have a nice collection. From Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dior and Prada, the Dolan Twins have managed to acquire quite the expansive and expensive designer wardrobe, much of it comes in handy from when they are invited to some of the most prestigious designer events in both the United States and across Europe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> This 7 Year Old Made $22 Million On YouTube In 2018</a></span></p><h2 id=wilderness-documentary><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Wilderness&nbsp;Documentary</span></h2><p>Both Ethan and Dolan took it upon themselves to step away from filming content for their YouTuber channel every week to pursue their lifelong goals of travelling and enjoying life without the pressure to create content. This led the two to invest in their very own documentary series where they travelled to Australia and filmed themselves surviving in the wilderness for as long as they could! While this is not the biggest hit to their bank account, a trip over to the land down under certainly ain't cheap!</p><h2 id=music-festivals><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Music Festivals</span></h2><p>The Dolan Twins have an act for being the center of attention at music festivals, and we are not one bit mad about it. The two are veteran attendees of the esteemed Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California. Not only is their fashion choices one of the best, but the two don't skimp out on the experience. Ethan and Grayson are VIP members who rent out the best houses and enjoy the festival the best way they can. If anyone has ever attended Coachella, you'd know just how costly this three-weekend festival can be!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vegan-foods><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Vegan Foods</span></h2><p>Lastly, but certainly not least, the Dolan Twins have switched over to a completely vegan lifestyle! This means they do not eat any form of animal by-product whatsoever. The duo has eaten meat their entire lives, so the switch was not only difficult for them mentally and physically, but also took a toll on their bank account. Vegan foods are exponentially more expensive than their previous lifestyle, and you know that they are getting the best of the best products!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Known Facts About Hugh Jackman's Personal Life</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqKSRo3q1w8inqmamlal6uLvRrZ9mbV2itq24yKilZrGfqsG2rsRmqq2Zoqh6tLzEp5uippdiuaqyxKyrsqSVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
