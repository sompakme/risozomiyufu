So far, the breakup has involved a nasty case of COVID-19, a threesome and a 22-year old nanny. Yes, you read that right. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline of their divorce</a> has been so complicated and straight-up weird that the details are confusing. Even by 2020 standards. So what exactly went down?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We have done some research to help fans understand what exactly went down in the couples’ separation, as well as how much money is actually at stake. Read on for the inside scoop on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why Jim and Meghan broke up</a> and what’s next for the newly divorced pair.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Filming Secrets About The Real Housewives</a></span></p><h2 id=a-three-part-cheating-scandal>A Three-Part Cheating Scandal</h2><p>The primary motive for Jim and Meghan’s separation was infidelity. And not on Meghan’s part. The relationship began to unravel when Jim confessed to Meghan that he was actually sending dirty pictures to another woman. In a statement to&nbsp;Us Weekly,&nbsp;the former baseball player admitted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was not faithful to his wife</a>. “I engaged in an inappropriate conversation,” Jim stated, before going on to insist, “At no time was there any kind of relationship or physical contact.” But could Meghan ever forgive his transgressions? Based on what happened next, the answer to that question would be a ‘hard no.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not long after owning up&nbsp;to his lack of fidelity, Jim was spotted at a hockey game. There would be nothing unusual about that, if he weren’t on a date. With his children’s twenty-two year old nanny. Who is the exact same age as Jim’s daughter from a previous marriage. Yes, he literally went out with a girl the same age as his own daughter. Obviously, the situation was super awkward, as TV fans snapped pictures of the unlikely pair and posted them online for everyone to see. Including Meghan.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Kylie Richards Close With Her Niece Paris Hilton?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The mother of two soon published a blog post where she opened up about what it was like to see the pictures of her husband out with another woman. “To be clear, I don’t know whether <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim slept with our babysitter</a>, or whether they were being exceedingly inappropriate by hanging out socially without either of them telling me (and Jim expressly lying to me about it.)” That definitely sounds sketchy.</p><p>Jim officially filed for divorce, just before contracting a case of COVID-19, but Meghan says not to feel too bad for him. In a podcast episode, the real housewife revealed that Jim had already moved on and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was seeing Kortnie O’Connor</a>. AKA: the very woman that had enjoyed a threesome with the couple in the past. Um, what? Clearly this divorce was very necessary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Housewives: 10 Fights That Transcended The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=the-divorce-amp-its-dirty-details>The Divorce & Its Dirty Details</h2><p>Getting a divorce might seem obvious but what about the parsing of resources? If the pair’s time in court is anything to go by, the answer to that question is: ‘not so much.’ The biggest issue in the separation was money, since Jim wanted to abide by what was agreed upon in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple’s prenup</a>. Meghan, on the other hand, has gone on record claiming that the previously accepted sums were hardly sufficient to keep her family afloat. “That child support is not paying me gold and baubles,” Meghan wrote in an Instagram comment, according to&nbsp;E! News.&nbsp;She went on to add, “It barely pays for groceries for my tribe!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jim, however, disagrees about the amount of money that he owes his ex-wife, reports the outlet. One of his reps has even stepped up to defend the unfaithful father. “He is letting her live in one of his homes in St. Louis and is paying the mortgage and all the bills for that house. He gives her money for her full time housekeeper. He pays for practically every single expense related to the children.” How generous.</p><p>Meghan has declined to share exactly how much Jim has paid up to-date. She has also refused to comment on the amount of money that she would like for Jim to contribute. “I don’t wish to discuss the private details of my divorce at this time,” she said.&nbsp;Nonetheless, it is clear that she is unhappy with the current situation. Perhaps she would like&nbsp;to seek a bit more recompense for all of the heartache she has suffered in her marriage to Jim.</p><p>In her blog post, Meghan wrote, “I am broken for my family. I am buried in dispair. I cry at the drop of a hat.” We wish her a soulful recovery in light of her sadness. We hope she moves forward towards a loving future relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Housewives: 10 Most Explosive Reunions</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknp%2BYlrtut8innmadlKK8r7DSZqGipV2asa67zZ2qZpyZq7yzr8Rmqp6spKGyrrHNrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
