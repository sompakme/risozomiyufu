Members<strong> <a href=#>Aubrey O'Day</a></strong> and <strong>Shannon Bex</strong> announced the news themselves in lengthy posts via Twitter on Friday, Aug. 8. The decision to pull the plug comes just days after <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported that O'Day and fellow member <strong>Dawn Richard</strong> got into a scuffle during a studio rehearsal.</p><p>"During a recent group meeting, a business conversation took a turn for the worst when my group member punched me in the back of my head while I was speaking to another associate. To be clear, she was not physically engaged or threatened prior to her attack on me," O'Day claimed in her statement, without naming her alleged attacker. "This is the same information I provided to the police, and witnesses also corroborated this account of the incident."</p><p>"It breaks my heart that this violence is followed by no sign of remorse. For the past year, I watched small lies turn into bigger lies. Those bigger lies turned into verbal abuse. Now the verbal abuse has deteriorated into a physical assault," she continued.</p><p>O'Day added that she tried "tirelessly to sympathize with the behavior," but "watched her behavior get darker and darker." Because of that, O'Day can no longer pretend that the person is willing "to do what it takes to protect the power of the Danity Kane name." In a separate post, Bex recalled the band's journey and shed light on the "broken ending" that left her heart "heavy."</p><p>The incident doesn't seem to be the only reason for the band's demise. A source also tells <strong>Us</strong> that the women were "always at odds," and "they couldn't agree on anything."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Danity Kane was created by <strong>Diddy</strong> during MTV's Making the Band in 2005. After splitting in 2009, the band reunited at the <a href=#>MTV Video Music Awards</a> last August and released their <a href=#>comeback single </a>"Lemonade" in May. <a href=#>As <strong>Us</strong> exclusively reported,</a> member <strong>D. Woods </strong>was not part of the reunion. <a href=#><strong>Aundrea Fimbres</strong> tearfully announced</a> her departure and that she was engaged during the group's performance in San Francisco on May 16.</p><p>Read O'Day and Bex's full statements <a href=#>here.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZ6ewbp5ypqlnmWjpbmqwNJmpqedXa6yor6Mmp2tnaJirq%2B6zq6lnKGenHqzsdSnoKimXaeyorCMrKuarJWisq%2FAjGtnamxobXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
