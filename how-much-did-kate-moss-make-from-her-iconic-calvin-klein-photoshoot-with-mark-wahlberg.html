They were everywhere. These women worked so hard to make it on their own terms. Now<a href=#> some of those iconic models have daughters in the business</a>. This includes <a href=#>Moss' own daughter, Lila</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Kate Moss Rarely Agrees To Interviews These Days And Her Reasoning Seems To Be Understandable">Kate Moss Rarely Agrees To Interviews These Days And Her Reasoning Seems To Be Understandable</a></span></p><p>Kate Moss started modeling at the age of 14. She was primarily doing catalog shoots for fashion houses in the greater London region of England. In 1992, however, at the ripe age of 17 years old, Kate Moss became a global sensation. The term household name doesn't even begin to cover it.</p><h2 id=how-did-calvin-klein-become-famous>How Did Calvin Klein Become Famous?</h2><p>Established in 1968, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it wasn't until 1980, when </a>Calvin asked photographer Richard Avedon to shoot a series of commercials featuring an actress and model named Brooke Shields, who was only 15 years old at the time, that its popularity went through the roof.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Johnny-Depp--Kate-Moss.jpg><p>The most striking image from the shoot is Brooke bending almost uncomfortably with her legs tilted apart, creating an awkward stance. The camera begins to rise gradually when she glances up and utters the now-famous statement, "Want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing."</p><p>And that is how the first contentious advertising campaign got started, with the idea that persuasive images would be more successful than basic ads.</p><h2 id=kate-moss-39-first-calvin-klein-ad-with-marky-mark>Kate Moss' First Calvin Klein Ad With Marky Mark</h2><p>In the 1990s, everyone knew Mark Wahlberg as Marky Mark, from Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. Yea, he was a rapper turned actor, thankfully. Nevertheless, he was just as good looking and just as ripped (if not more) 30 years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kate-moss-calvin-klein-mark-wahlberg.jpg><p>Originally, Calvin Klein requested Mark Wahlberg and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanessa Paradis for the controversial</a> ad. Vanessa, who coincidentally was in a very long term relationship with Johnny Depp at the time, turned it down. Moss reluctantly stepped in. (It is rather creepy how much the two look like each other.) And the rest is history.</p><p>As far as getting paid, we don't have an exact figure, but some research from around that time frame can give us an idea. Like mentioned, these supermodels were really making a name for themselves in the '90s. In fact, in the October 1990 issue of Vogue, Linda Evangelista is quoted as saying, "We don't get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day." That was in reference to her and Christy Turlington.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="What Happened Between Kate Moss And Mark Wahlberg?">What Happened Between Kate Moss And Mark Wahlberg?</a></span></p><p>While it is doubtful Kate made $10,000 for the day, we're guessing it was a decent amount, being topless and all. Also, her 2006 contract with Calvin Klein was worth $1.5 million, so we know they pay well.</p><h2 id=how-did-kate-moss-feel-about-her-calvin-klein-mark-wahlberg-ad>How Did Kate Moss Feel About Her Calvin Klein/Mark Wahlberg Ad?</h2><p>In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Lauren Laverne, Kate Moss opened up about feeling "vulnerable" and "scared" while working alongside actor Mark Wahlberg on the set. She added, "He was very macho, and it was all about him. He had a big entourage. I was just this kind of model, and I think they took advantage of my vulnerability."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kate-moss-skims.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also said that she had "severe anxiety" before the shoot, so a doctor gave her Valium."I really didn't feel well at all before the shoot. For like a week or two, I couldn't get out of bed," she said.</p><h2 id=kate-moss-39-career-after-her-calvin-klein-debut>Kate Moss' Career After Her Calvin Klein Debut</h2><p>Kate Moss' career with Calvin Klein was not a one-and-done. She ran multiple campaigns for him. In 1993, she chose to show even more skin in her Obsession ad. Her boyfriend at the time was photographer Mario Sorrenti; Calvin Klein gave them film and freedom, and they created some amazing shots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kate-moss-at-paris-fashion-week-s-springsummer-2023yves-saint-laurent-photocall.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She said she would never do it, but as the new millennium got underway, she chopped off her recognizable long hair and appeared with a platinum blonde wedge. Many of the leading designers all of a sudden wanted to feature her in their advertising campaigns. The moment's hottest designer, Tom Ford, ultimately secured her for the Gucci line.</p><p>Kate had a daughter with Jefferson Hack, who used to be the editor of the fashion magazine Dazed & Confused. This happened after she broke up with Johnny Depp in May 1998. (now known as Dazed) Lila Grace was born in September 2002, and Moss and Hack ended their relationship in early 2004.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Kate Moss Lives A Glamorous Lifestyle Thanks To Her Insane Net Worth">Kate Moss Lives A Glamorous Lifestyle Thanks To Her Insane Net Worth</a></span></p><p>In 2007, she released her first line of clothes for Topshop. The line, called Kate Moss for Topshop, was based on her own style. She also did a second collection for the fall/winter 2010–2011 season, as well as working with Longchamp on a line of handbags. This kind of work carried her through for some time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Kate opened her own modeling and talent agency, simply called, Kate Moss Agency. The first person she signed was her daughter, Lila Moss.</p><h2 id=does-kate-moss-39-s-daughter-work-for-calvin-klein>Does Kate Moss's Daughter Work For Calvin Klein?</h2><p>Lila has been modeling since she was 14, just like her mother. She has done runway shows for fashion week and is the face of a few different fashion house campaigns. 30 years after Kate originally posed for Calvin Klein in 1992, her 19-year-old daughter was featured in the brand's Autumn 2022 campaign. The commercial, which debuted on Wednesday, highlighted the company's newest loungewear and undergarments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kate-moss-and-lila-moss.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She wore slightly more than her mother did for her ad, looking stunning in a black tank top for one appearance, along with hip-hugging jeans that showed the waistband of her CK brand underwear. Her next look was a sheer black button-down placed over a bra and paired with black jeans.</p><p>Currently, Kate Moss is extremely happy in life. She is doing everything she wants to do. Her net worth is $70 million. Daughter Lila Grace Moss is said to have a net worth of between $2 million and $5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqyVYrqwv9Jmmpqkpp67brfLnqCnZaOWuaK%2B2GanoaekpMCpu86tZLChpJ16rq3RpGSwmZihr6a%2Bxmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
