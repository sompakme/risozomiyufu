A TV source said she the host has personally prepared a statement because she wants to tell viewers how difficult it has been for everyone behind the scenes on the show.
She has been absent from the set for the past two weeks — during which time her former pal, 61, has come clean about his affair with a much younger ITV runner."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She wants to put her best foot forward and help be a part of the shift backstage, where everyone is happy.</p><p>“Obviously, the reports of on-set toxicity have been upsetting to hear and Holly hopes this is the start of new era for the show and that they can pull together.</p><p>“Producers are hopeful Holly will now steer the ship towards calmer waters for the next six weeks before her summer break.”</p><p>Our source said when Holly is off for the summer, “bigger decisions will be made about a rebrand of the show, with new credits and a soundtrack to signify the new era — and distance itself from Phil’s reign”.</p><p>Last week, Phillip said <a href=#>he texted Holly</a> as the affair story broke, writing: “I know you can’t reply, you’re probably not allowed, but please know I’m desperately sorry.”</p><p>Our source said Holly has still not made contact with Phillip, but is saddened that he has been suffering with his mental health.</p><p>They added: “Holly hasn’t engaged with Phil, but is upset he has been feeling so low.”</p><p>Holly has not commented since<a href=#> taking to social media</a> last weekend to reveal Phillip had lied to her about his affair.</p><p>She wrote last Saturday: “It’s taken time to process yesterday’s news. When reports of this relationship first surfaced, I asked Phil directly if this was true and was told it was not. It’s been very hurtful to now find out this was a lie.”</p><p>On Friday’s This Morning, <a href=#>Alison broke down in tears</a> as she discussed The Sun’s exclusive interview with Phillip, in which he spoke of feeling suicidal.</p><p>She said she feared he could only take so much.</p><p>Alison, who has worked on the show with Phillip for more than two decades, was struggling when it came to the newspaper review.</p><p>For days, This Morning had ignored the fall-out of Phillip’s admission about his affair, despite the story being splashed across The Sun’s front pages.</p><p>But on Friday, &nbsp;presenters took time to discuss his <a href=#>exclusive interview with The Sun</a>.</p><p>Alison appeared alongside co-presenter Dermot when she admitted she was finding the scandal difficult to process.</p><p>Dermot told viewers: “It’s very difficult for us to cover this story because he’s a friend and a colleague.”</p><p>Tearful Alison continued: “I’m just finding it really painful because obviously I loved Phillip Schofield and it’s weird because I still love Phillip Schofield.</p><p>“However what he has done is wrong. He’s admitted it. He’s said sorry but, as a family, we’re all really struggling to process.”</p><p>She later admitted she feared for Phillip’s <a href=#>mental health</a>, adding: “There is so much a man can take isn’t there?
