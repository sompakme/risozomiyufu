After all, the hunky British star has been making waves for the past decade thanks to work in Game of Thrones as well as The Bodyguard. But Richard's celebrity status has also been growing due to all the news about his dating life. While<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> some celebrity couples appear to be in it for the long-haul</a>, others last about 30 minutes. Richard Madden's relationship with the gorgeous Ellie Bamber falls into the latter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some celebrities who have broken up before eventually getting married</a>, it doesn't appear as though Richard Madden is getting back together with this mysterious redhead (and sometimes blonde). But that doesn't make us any less curious about her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Redheads Who Bring The Heat</a></span></p><p>So, just who is Ellie Bamber and why does she look so familiar?</p><h2 id=ellie-is-a-fairly-successful-actor>Ellie Is A Fairly Successful Actor</h2><p>Actually, this may be an understatement. Many would say that Ellie Bamber is more than just a fairly successful actor. In fact, they would say that she is a 'rising star'. And she may very well be.</p><p>Ellie (AKA Elanor Elizabeth) was born in 1997 in England. She is best known for her small role in Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals as well as her role as Cosette in the BBC One television adaptations of Les Misérables. Ellie also had bigger roles in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies as well as The Nutcracker And The Four Realms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She started acting in theater at the age of 12, making her the youngest member ever of the Player's Theater Club. Ellie quickly gained the attention of numerous casting directors and was chosen to appear in various plays, including High Society put on by The Old Vic in London. This was the last production under Kevin Spacey's hand as Artistic Director.</p><p>Around the same time, Ellie was starting to appear on the screen. Her first role was in a mini-series called A Mother's Son and then a movie called The Falling. Her first major picture was Pride and Prejudice and Zombies where she played Lydia Bennett.</p><p>The same year, director Tom Ford featured her in Nocturnal Animals, where she played the daughter of Jake Gyllenhaal and Isla Fisher. In the film, she was part of one of the most horrific scenes in the movie which took a toll on her, according to her interview with Glamour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The exposure brought Ellie to Shawn Mendes, who featured her in his music video for "There's Nothing Holding Me Back" where she played his girlfriend.</p><p>It also got her cast in more projects such as Extracurricular Activities, High Resolution, The Show, and Disney's The Nutcracker And The Four Realms.</p><p>On top of her role as Cosette, Ellie also had major roles in two series, The Serpent and The Trial Of Christine Keeler.</p><p>Ellie's career in film and television doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon as she's currently filming or in pre-production on four more films.</p><h2 id=ellie-is-becoming-a-fixture-in-the-fashion-world>Ellie Is Becoming A Fixture In The Fashion World</h2><p>According to Grazia, all of the attention brought on by Ellie's film and television career caught the attention of some major names in the fashion industry. Now she has an assortment of designers, including the late-Karl Lagerfeld dressing her for runway shows and print ads.</p><p>Her alabaster skin and doll-like features (not to mention her insanely nice hair) has definitely struck a positive chord with the fashion world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All The Celebrity Babies Born In 2020, During Quarantine</a></span></p><h2 id=inside-ellie-s-relationship-with-the-game-of-thrones-star>Inside Ellie's Relationship With The Game Of Thrones Star</h2><p>In January 2019, the then-32-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Madden was dumped </a>by the then-21-year-old Ellie Bamber. Yes, Richard clearly likes them much younger. And perhaps this is one of the reasons they broke up.</p><p>While Ellie and Richard dated for 18 months, they would get into arguments on the daily. According to The Mirror, a source said of their break-up: "They were arguing almost daily towards the end and, despite considering couples’ therapy, it became evident there were far too many issues that could not be fixed."</p><p>The two met via a mutual friend in the summer of 2017. And much like most of Richard's celebrity girlfriends, the two were hot and heavy. Their photos were everywhere and fans were wondering all about the gorgeous (and much younger) redhead Richard was parading around with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is especially true when the two were caught in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">major PDA while vacationing in Ibiza</a>.</p><p>But now their relationship is done and Richard Madden has moved onto an assortment of other gorgeous stars. Ellie Bamber, on the other hand, has remained far more tight-lipped about her romantic life, even telling Glamour, "I am my own independent woman, so why does it matter who I date?"</p><p>Perhaps Ellie learned something from all the press her relationship with Richard brought? Perhaps now she prefers to remain under the radar so her work is what speaks for her and not which ripped stud she has on her arm...</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrity Couples Who Had Their Marriages Annulled (& Why)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuvsicn5qqlGK6orDDnqWsZZWteqa4y6KcZpqRoq%2Bmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
