However, the show has been on an extended hiatus, and fans are wondering if a third season is coming at some point.</p><p>Let's take a look at the status of Derry Girls season 3.</p><h2 id=derry-girls-debuted-in-2018>Derry Girls Debuted In 2018</h2><p>Back in 2018, Derry Girls made its official debut, and the series garnered impeccable reviews upon its release. People loved a number of different elements that the show utilized, including its setting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's set during the troubles in Ireland in the 90s. What's really interesting is that, like a lot of people that have suffered, one of the way you cope with suffering is through humour. I think that for Irish people to undermine whatever trauma they are experiencing by trying to laugh at it is part of our natural response," said actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tommy Tiernan</a>.</p><p>The show's focus is on a group of young girls, and one guy, navigating their adolescence during a contentious period in Ireland's history. Despite this, the series has been relatable to people of all ages, which is why it was able to catch on so quickly with audiences.</p><p>Saoirse-Monica Jackson, who actually grew up in Derry, talked about the show, saying, "It portrays Derry so well. Yes, we have a harsh sense of humour, and Lisa really does go there. People are mental in Derry: they will just tell you exactly what they think.”</p><p>Thankfully, the success of season one gave way to a second season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s Why Fans Think There Will Be A ‘Real Housewives Of Nashville’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-39-s-had-two-successful-seasons>It's Had Two Successful Seasons</h2><p>Season two of Derry Girls came to the small screen back in 2019, and much like its first season, it was met with critical acclaim and was devoured by fans of the show. It also did a fantastic job in roping in new fans, which has increased the calls for a third season over time.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicola Coughlan</a>, who plays the lovable Clare on the show, talked about the popularity of Derry Girls, saying, "I went to New York, and loads of people stopped us to talk about the show and buy us shots in bars. It’s unbelievable how far it has travelled."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She would even go on to say that she has received messages from fans in countries around the world. Despite the time period and the setting, Derry Girls has managed to rope in a global audience over time. This is a testament to just how fantastic the series is when it's firing on all cylinders.</p><p>It has now been a couple of years since the release of the second season of Derry Girls, and there are a number of reasons why things have yet to progress. This lapse in time does have fans wondering if a third season of Derry Girls will ever come to the small screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will There Be A 'Cruella 2'? 10 Things We've Learned About The Planned Sequel</a></span></p><h2 id=will-there-be-a-season-3>Will There Be A Season 3?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, will there be a third season of Derry Girls? Thankfully, fans of the show can breathe easy, because a third season is officially in the works! Unfortunately, there is a dash of news that comes with this that might bum some people out.</p><p>According to Tara Lynne-O'Neill, "It's happening this year, it's definitely happening this year! If we leave it another year, we'll all be old-age pensioners!"</p><p>As great as this is, it should be noted that the third season of Derry Girls will be its last.</p><p>Series creator, Lisa McGee, made this official, saying, "It was always the plan to say goodbye after three series. Derry Girls is a coming of age story; following five ridiculous teenagers as they slowly...very slowly...start to become adults while around them the place they call home starts to change too and Northern Ireland enters a new more hopeful phase — which was a small, magical window of time. Derry Girls is a love letter to the place I come from and the people who shaped me. It has been an honour to write it and I will be forever proud of everything it's achieved."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will There Be A 'Fast & Furious 10 & 11'?
