His father, Samuel Nowlin Reeves Jr., was a heroin addict who abandoned his children and also did his time in jail for <strong>the drug-related </strong>crime.&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel spent decades <strong>begging to reconcile </strong>with his estranged son but did not want his father in his life.</p><p>&nbsp;Sources also said that Keanu cut ties with the rest of his family as well. Samuel took the last breath on <i>26th January 2018</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>His last wish was to make up with his son Keanu whom he has not seen and heard anything in years.
