Now, it seems the battle is over. The Toronto rapper shared an Instagram post hinting at him being done with the <a href=#>feud</a> and looking toward the feature.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 6 God referred to the beef as a “20 v 1” multiple times, as he had to contend with <a href=#>Future</a>, <a href=#>Metro Boomin</a>, <a href=#>Rick Ross</a>, <a href=#>The Weeknd</a>, and <a href=#>A$AP Rocky</a> in addition to K. Dot. Continuing that theme, he shared a photo of a soldier holding a sword while a cavalry stood across from him.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While he was previously willing to engage with all of his opponents, his caption for this Instagram Story post said otherwise. “Good times,” he wrote. “Summer vibes up next.” Many fans have interpreted this post as him officially waving the white flag. Several fans believe he had already lost, so this supposed admission of defeat yielded the 37-year-old rapper even more jokes than he was already receiving.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Drake’s Red Button was making a lie up this whole time ????????????????????????????????????</p>— TY-RIN (@GothamCityGoon) <a href=# rel=nofollow>May 12, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Drake’s post also brings about an interesting parallel to a previous beef in his career. In 2018, Drake went toe-to-toe with <a href=#>Pusha T</a>. It began with “<a href=#>Infrared</a>” on the Clipse rapper’s album Daytona. Drizzy fired back with “<a href=#>Duppy Freestyle</a>,” and Push responded with “<a href=#>The Story Of Adidon</a>,” which infamously revealed that he was hiding his son Adonis from the world.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">There were rumors brewing of the For All The Dogs artist working on a diss track that would “end” the Virginia rapper, but it never saw the light of day. Instead, he continued the rollout of his 2018 album Scorpion which included hits like “<a href=#>God’s Plan</a>,” “<a href=#>Nice For What</a>,” “<a href=#>Nonstop</a>,” and “<a href=#>In My Feelings</a>.” He took over the summer with those records and his feature on <a href=#>Travis Scott’s “Sicko Mode.”</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Thus, with the part-time crooner now looking toward the summer, he may be gearing up to repair his public image by unloading a similar slew of hits. Of course, that would go against last year’s announcement that he was <a href=#>taking a break</a> from music. Time will tell what the five-time Grammy winner ultimately decides to do.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Drake and Kendrick Lamar’s feud has been mostly subliminal over the last decade, but it got heated this past March with Lamar’s appearance on Future and Metro Boomin’s “<a href=#>Like That</a>.” He directly referenced the idea of him, Drizzy, and J. Cole being part of a “Big 3,” before denouncing it and saying it is just “Big Me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">From there, the Degrassi actor responded with “<a href=#>Push Ups</a>,” and the <a href=#>now-deleted</a> “<a href=#>Taylor Made Freestyle</a>” in the middle of April. The Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers rapper took some time before dropping “<a href=#>Euphoria</a>” at the end of April and “<a href=#>6:16 In LA</a>” three days later.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Not to be outdone, Drake released “<a href=#>Family Matters</a>” later that evening only to be overshadowed by Lamar releasing “Meet The Grahams” less than an hour later. The Compton, Calif. rapper shared “<a href=#>Not Like Us</a>” the following evening, which has taken on a life of its own with chants like “OV-H**!” and “certified pedophile.” The OVO head honcho shared “<a href=#>The Heart Part 6</a>” last Sunday (May 5), and what appears to be the end of the beef…for now.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m%2ForfEZqqenZ2eu6i42GaZqK%2BjYry2wIyknKecop6wrHnLmqSaql2XsqayjGppbGxobIVyfZRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
