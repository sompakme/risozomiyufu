It did not take Pitt long to prove himself in Hollywood, and over time, he has turned in one incredible performance after the next. Sure, his love life, particularly his relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a>, is covered by the media, but for the most part Pitt is known for his incredible acting abilities and for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eating in all his movies</a>.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Over the years, Brad Pitt has amassed an incredible net worth, and he has done this by dipping his toes into different ventures. As time has gone on, Pitt is currently sitting pretty and living his best life.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, how did Brad Pitt accumulate such an incredible amount of wealth? Let’s take a look at his different ventures and see where all this cash is coming from!</span></p><h2 id=that-movie-money>That Movie Money</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Brad Pitt is best known for being an actor and a talented one at that. Though it took him some time to land huge roles, he would quickly show the world that he was among the best of the bunch. Naturally, he was able to start commanding a hefty salary for the films that he would star in.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Typically, Brad Pitt commands up to $20 million per film, according to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>GQ</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. This is in line with the norm for A-list stars, and it is a massive amount of money for any person taking on one project.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Of course, this type of pay does fluctuate at times, as </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>GQ</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> also reports that Pitt cut his salary down to $10 million to appear in the film </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Still, $10 million is nothing to scoff at for any performer.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sometimes, however, Pitt can get a bump in pay, and this happened back when he was part of the ensemble cast of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Ocean’s Eleven</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. All in all, Pitt would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net himself $30 million</a> for performing in the movie, which is a staggering sum of money! It just goes to show what a performer like Pitt can command when things align just right.</span></p><p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Close Brad Pitt And Ed Norton Got While Filming ‘Fight Club’</a></p><h2 id=real-estate-moves>Real Estate Moves</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aside from making a fortune by appearing in huge films and winning Academy Awards, Brad Pitt has also made sure to expand his horizons into other territories. Real estate is a common venture for the rich and famous, so it should not be surprising to see Pitt make some money in this arena.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Entertainment Times</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> did some digging into Brad Pitt’s time investing in real estate, and they learned quite a bit about the performer. Of note, they learned that he has managed to do quite well for himself in real estate.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to the site, “The actor has also made some smart investments worth about $100 million on various real estates. His primary house is in Los Angeles, which he managed to purchase after a string of transactions over the years. The property spans over two acres and includes four homes along with a huge main house measuring around 6,600 square-feet.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This is quite the haul for someone that has spent the bulk of his time acting in movies. Real estate is a tricky business to get into, and it is clear that Pitt had the wherewithal to surround himself with people that could help him make the most of a great opportunity.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Clearly, Pitt knows a thing or two about making money, and these two ventures alone would have been fine for other people. Of course, Brad Pitt is known for doing things his way.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt And Leonardo DiCaprio Swear By This Secret Cheat Meal</a></span></p><h2 id=investing-for-the-long-road>Investing For The Long Road</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Real estate and movies have been quite nice to Brad Pitt, and despite this, he has also managed to venture out into other territories for cash. Despite sounding cliche for the Hollywood elite, Pitt is also known for making some savvy investments to help line his pockets and to enrich his life.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Just last year, it was reported that Pitt had invested in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cold fusion energy company</a>. This certainly made headlines, as many celebrities are seen investing in companies that don’t deal in energy. Nevertheless, it is clear that Brad Pitt has his eye towards the future, and he wants to see a company that can produce clean energy succeed.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Time will tell if this winds up being a lucrative venture for Pitt, but we do know that this will certainly have other celebrities looking into making a similar investment. Any company that can help the environment is certainly going to pique the interest of those trying to make a difference, and Industrial Heat wound up being the company that got Brad Pitt’s cash.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Times Brad Pitt and George Clooney’s Bromance Had Us Dying Of Laughter</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thanks to all of his ventures, Brad Pitt sits on a fortune that should keep him and his children comfortable for a long time.
