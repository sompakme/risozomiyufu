Now that the Good Morning America weather reporter's divorce has been made public, here's everything we know.</p><h2 id=when-did-this-happen>When Did This Happen?</h2><p>Good Morning America's Rob Marciano and his ex-wife Eryn never gave any indication that their marriage was going badly, but to be fair, most celebrities tend not to show that aspect of their lives to the world to protect their privacy. As it is, the former couple has managed to keep their divorce a secret for a long time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is The Richest 'Good Morning America' Host?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the court documents that Us Magazine collected</a>, it was Eryn Marciano who filed for divorce first, although apparently, it was a mutual decision. The divorce paperwork was filed on June 28, 2021, following an order for a trial, which was filed on May 10. It's remarkable that they have managed to keep things quiet for over a year.</p><h2 id=they-seem-to-co-parent-very-well>They Seem To Co-Parent Very Well</h2><p>Even though their romantic relationship ended, it doesn't mean that Rob and Eryn will just magically stop caring about each other. After all, at the moment they filed for divorce, they had been married for eleven years, having tied the knot in late 2010. Given that, and the fact that they have two young kids (Madelynn, 10, and Mason, 4), they seem to have an amicable relationship. This is very fortunate because they will be heavily involved in each other's lives forever, or at the very least until their kids are adults.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April, Rob posted a picture of him and Eryn in Disneyland with their children, and he hinted at their eventful year in a caption that said "Spring Break @waltdisneyworld — thru the chaos was much-needed kiddos quality time — their joy is as we say #magical." The meteorologist could also be referring to the craziness that has plagued the world since 2020, but the fact remains that there has been a divorce filing. No matter what he meant, it's nice to see that Rob and Eryn have maintained a good relationship.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Matt Lauer Lost Millions Once His Divorce Settlement To Ex-Wife Annette Roque Was Finalized</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZJqan6rBbr7Om2SmmaKYtqK6zqxkrJ2Tp7K1ecOiraiqk5p8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
