This young man started his NHL career with the Colorado Avalanche in 2017 after he was drafted by them as the fourth overall player that year. The Canadian’s NHL debut came at the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Calgary Flames. He even scored a goal then. Since then, the man has been a regular for the Avalanche. This right-handed shooter has played in 178 games (regular season) and scored 48 goals for them so far. He also has 132 assists and 180 points. These are impressive stats for a defenseman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wtfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/camprof.jpg><p>The Avalanche have made the playoffs once during his time with them, and they managed to win it too. Before becoming a professional, this young man used to play for the UMass Minuteman program. The youngster debuted against Arizona State University on October 6, 2017. As a junior, this player played for the Crowchild Blackhawks minor-hockey program before representing the NWCAA Bruins at the Bantam level.
