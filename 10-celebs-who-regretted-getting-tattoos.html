Talking about the removal process, Wahlberg compared it to "hot bacon grease getting flicked on you over and over again."</p><h2 id=jessica-alba><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jessica Alba</span></h2><p>Jessica Alba had one or two big regrets and that was the ink she got when she was younger.

When Cuoco <a href=#>was married to tennis pro Ryan Sweeting, </a>she got a tattoo on the middle of her back of their wedding date, December 31, 2013. However, the couple ended up getting divorced and Cuoco was left with a reminder of him permanently etched into her skin.</p><p>Instead of removing the ink altogether, Cuoco got it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">covered up with a massive moth</a>. During an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, the star shared that she got the huge moth because it had wings large enough to cover the roman numerals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jennifer Lawrence</span></h2><p>Jennifer Lawrence <a href=#>has a small tattoo on her right hand</a> close to her thumb which reads, "H20," a symbol for water, and a reminder for the actress is always stay hydrated.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Do Chris Pratt And Jennifer Lawrence Have Such Great Chemistry On Film?</a></span></p><p>What Lawrence did not realize at the time was that her tattoo was factually incorrect because the 2 in H20 should be lower and not higher when writing out the chemical formula for water.

However, in 2011, the actress began having the portrait of the iconic star removed because Fox <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wanted to avoid attracting "negative energy."</a></p><p>According to&nbsp;Daily Mail,&nbsp;Fox shared, "I'm removing it. It is a negative character, as she suffered from personality disorders and was bipolar.
