I’d been looked up and down, had people telling me what they thought of my body, since I was a teenager. Shaving my head and acting out were my ways of pushing back,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a sample of the book reads, PEOPLE reports</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney was placed in a conservatorship the following year, admitting she lost control over most of her personal freedom as a consequence, including how her hair looked. She also lost primary custody of her two sons.</p><p>“I was made to understand that those days were now over,” she wrote. “I had to grow my hair out and get back into shape. I had to go to bed early and take whatever medication they told me to take.”</p><p>During the 2007 incident, Britney walked into a California hair salon and requested her then-brown hair to be buzzed off. When the salon owner apparently refused to comply, Britney proceeded to grab a pair of clippers and do the deed herself.</p><p>Onlooking paparazzi got a series of footage of the singer shaving her head, which came only days before Britney attacked a photographer’s car with an umbrella.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-said-she-terminated-a-pregnancy-with-justin-timberlake>Britney Said She Terminated A Pregnancy With Justin Timberlake</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/justin-timberlake-hulu-candy-premiere.jpg><p>Britney makes a series of startling revelations in her memoir, including about her family and past relationship. Another striking confession is that she became pregnant during her relationship with Justin Timberlake, but ultimately decided to end the pregnancy after receiving pressure from him.</p><p>“I loved Justin so much. I always expected us to have a family together one day. This would just be much earlier than I’d anticipated,” the same excerpt from PEOPLE reads.</p><p>“But Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young,” the former Disney star went on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/britney-spears-have-a-relationship-with-kevin-federline-s-wife-victoria-prince-after-their-bitter-divorce_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did Britney Spears Have A Relationship With Kevin Federline's Wife Victoria Prince After Their Bitter Divorce?">Did Britney Spears Have A Relationship With Kevin Federline's Wife Victoria Prince After Their Bitter Divorce?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Britney Spears and her ex-husband Kevin Federline have had a toxic relationship, particularly after their divorce.</p><p>“I’m sure people will hate me for this, but I agreed not to have the baby,” Britney continued. “I don’t know if that was the right decision. If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.”</p><p>Britney didn’t confirm how old she was when the abortion took place, but it’s speculated she would’ve been in her late teens.</p><p>Justin hasn’t formally responded to Britney’s claims, but a report from earlier in the week claimed the singer was nervous about what his ex would reveal. “He’s very curious what she’ll reveal from their relationship,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Page Six</a>. “It’s eating at him.”</p><p>Britney has already <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said she hopes to release a sequel to the memoir</a>, so she’s clearly ready to tell the world her side of things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gko7K6edKpnJqqo2K%2FpsLEmqOsZaedxm6%2Fx55krKCRq7KleceemJ1lYmV9eHnPmqeaqpGvx6p5zJ6lrZmcYrWmrcutn2abop7Aqr%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
