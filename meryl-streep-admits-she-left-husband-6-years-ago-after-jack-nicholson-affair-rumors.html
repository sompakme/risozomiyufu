It's unclear if the long-time couple remains legally married and simply separated, or if they have filed for divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the revelation, Meryl was seen wearing her wedding band as recently as the 2023 Princesa de Asturias Awards in Spain last Friday. However, the parents-of-four haven’t publicly been seen together since 2018 when they attended as a couple.</p><p>Don and Meryl first met in 1978, thanks to a mutual connection – Streep's brother. The pair met when Meryl was mourning the loss of her boyfriend, fellow actor John Cazale, who had just succumbed to lung cancer. Nevertheless, Don and Meryl experienced an immediate connection, later deciding to tie the knot a mere six months later, exchanging vows at the actress’s parents' residence.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/dustin-hoffman-s-reaction-with-meryl-streep-on-set-would-ve-got-the-actor-canceled-from-hollywood-today.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Dustin Hoffman's Reaction With Meryl Streep On Set Would've Got The Actor Canceled From Hollywood Today</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dustin Hoffman got physical with Meryl Streep, causing problems between the two.</span><p>Together, Meryl and Don have a large family consisting of multiple children and grandchildren.

In a biography about Nicholson released the year prior, the author made the claim that Jack and Meryl had an affair in 1987 during the filming of "Ironweed." The romance allegedly occurred nine years into Meryl's marriage to Don. Meryl promptly denied the rumors of an affair at the time.</p><p>However, sources said that the book brought up old problems in Meryl’s marriage. “The book opened old wounds and that has led to bitter fights. Now, their marriage is struggling,” one source said at the time.</p><p>“Meryl just won’t slow down. But Don wants them to start enjoying their golden years. Don used to joke that Meryl works so much he never sees her. Now I don’t think he’s joking anymore,” they went on. “He’s demanded she slow down, and friends fear that if she doesn’t, their once-strong marriage could crumble.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meryl and Don haven’t released any further details on their split.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknqqpoXq0wNGenKlllKS7brPUpqSeql2ova2102awnpmiqHqis85moZqbm2K7qq%2FHqKOsp55irqeywKKpZqqloryzv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
