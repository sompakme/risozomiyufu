The timing coincided with the end of the relationship</strong>, and <a href=#>the name of the album, The Tortured Poets Department, can be interpreted as a dig at him</a>.</p><p>Joe Alwyn shared a few years ago that Paul Mescal, Andrew Scott, and him had a group chat which was called "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tortured Men Club"</a>, and fans instantly made the connection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that the track list has been revealed, the fandom has come up with even more theories about the meaning of the songs. Starting with the song "So Long, London". As it is public knowledge, Joe Alwyn is English, but even more relevant is that, on the album Lover, Taylor wrote a song called "London Boy" about him. There is also the theory that the track "Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?" could be a reference to the play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Given the title of the record, it would make sense to have references to poets there. The play is about a marriage that's falling apart, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, whose own relationship was incredibly complicated. But here's where it gets interesting: the song "...Ready For It?", which she wrote when she was with Joe, has a specific line that talks about him being the "Burton to this Taylor".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-else-can-we-expect-from-the-new-album>What Else Can We Expect From The New Album?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-2022-mtv-video-music-awards.jpg><p>As much as fan theories try to predict what Taylor Swift will do next (and sometimes they are eerily accurate), the singer always has some unexpected trick up her sleeve that manages to leave everyone stunned. Even when everyone had guessed that she was going to announce something at the 2024 Grammy Awards, she still surprised the world by announcing there was new material coming.</p><p>Fans were expecting a re-recording of one of her old albums, specifically reputation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ttweb_did-taylor-swift-ever-write-a-song-about-tom-hiddleston-_bk_a1_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did Taylor Swift Ever Write A Song About Tom Hiddleston?">Did Taylor Swift Ever Write A Song About Tom Hiddleston?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has written some iconic songs about her ex boyfriends, but is Tom Hiddleston one of them?</p><p>It's safe to say, then, that no matter how many predictions and connections fans come up with (and whether they are about Joe Alwyn or any of her other exes), she will still blow people away when the album comes out on April 19th. <strong>So far, going by the aesthetic of the album, fans can probably expect something resembling Folklore and Evermore. </strong>There are also two (so far) collaborations to look forward to. One with Post Malone, and one with Florence + The Machine. As the release date gets closer, surely we'll get more hints about what the next masterpiece will be like.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYrCwus2emq2hnpx6tLvNoGStoaShsrR505qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZKedp2Kura7UpmSjp5Virq3D2Kdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
