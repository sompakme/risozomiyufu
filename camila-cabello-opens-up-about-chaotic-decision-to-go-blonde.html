In the social media clip, she pushed her wet hair around while showing her dark roots and bangs. “It’s time >:),” she captioned the post, seemingly teasing new music.</p><p>In addition to hair, Cabello has been experimenting with her fashion sense. “I think what’s been lighting me up is, I don’t know, some grunge, some Y2K styles,” she told Puss Puss.</p><p>“I also discovered Dover Street Market, and that was a big game changer for me, seeing more kinds of weird out of the states fashion brands. It’s just something I was never around when I was younger.”</p><p>She gushed that she “fell in love” with fashion and uses clothes as a “language” for “the period in my life that I’m in.” She continued, “I think the music influences how I dress and how I dress kind of feeds back into the music.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although Cabello has not yet announced the name of her album or a release date, she teased that fans can expect “reinvention” of herself. “I feel like so much of the album has a through line and there’s definitely more <a href=#>themes that the album touches</a>,” she explained, adding that the project touches on feeling “confused” and “lonely” after a breakup.</p><p>“It’s just kind of me wrestling with these feelings and me kind of being really present on a particular feeling and exploring it. I feel like a lot of songs on the album are that.”</p><p>Cabello dated <strong>Shawn Mendes</strong> for over two years before calling it quits in 2021. They briefly rekindled their love in April 2023, but again split two months later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5iurrXLmmScmZKaua27jKinnqajYsKxecCbpq6sXZi1orvToppmnJWYtrS1zqdkraddnLxursuopZ2dXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
