Like, I was joking, we were at a shoot earlier and I’m sitting like this stepping. And they’re like, ‘What are you doing?’ I was like, ‘Getting steps,’” Haines exclusively told Us about her fitness plan after giving birth to her third child, Caleb Joseph, in late June.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sara-Haines-Lost-Her-Baby-Weight-Toning-Excerises.jpg><p>Haines, who was an honoree at Us Weekly’s bash, also revealed that she tried to get ahead of the weight gain by not overindulging when she was pregnant.</p><p>“Well, I always tried to watch in pregnancy because I know that’s an old tale: ‘You’re eating for two.’ The baby’s this big, he’s not eating much,” Haines told Us. “But I always watched during pregnancy that I didn’t put on too much.</p><p>Haines and her husband, lawyer <strong>Max Shifrin</strong>, whom she wed in November 2014, are also the parents of Alec Richard, 3, and Sandra Grace, 20 months.</p><p>She said that the reality of taking care of three children hasn’t hit her yet.</p><p>“I think to three, I haven’t really completely noticed because you already know that you just are going to have to divide and conquer,” Haines told Us. “So I don’t think I’ve felt the jump as supremely. It’s just keeping those toddlers, who are, like, climbing the walls, alive.”</p><p>Haines admitted that she was stressed when she found herself expecting a third baby while cohosting a talk show.</p><p>She said she and her husband “always thought we wanted three,” but the timing clashed with her cohosting duties.</p><p>“And when it happened, I was crying to my husband and I’m like, ‘Why now?’” Haines recalled. “You have to just make a choice. So I had been saying my whole time, ‘I’m going to take four weeks. I need to be medically ready and a doctor needs to tell me I’m OK, but I got to go back.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Haines returned on the air after taking a one-month absence for maternity leave.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGahp6diwKK%2BwGafmqGemsBuuM6sq2aakZfGbsPEop6hrF2strW0jJ6vnqqTnsCmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
