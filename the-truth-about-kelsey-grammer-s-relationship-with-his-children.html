Today, the actor is a proud father of seven.</p><h2 id=spencer-grammer-remains-close-with-her-dad-even-after-starting-a-family-of-her-own>Spencer Grammer Remains Close With Her Dad Even After Starting A Family Of Her Own</h2><p>Spencer is the comedian’s oldest daughter and just like Kelsey, she happens to be a successful onscreen actor and voice talent. In fact, Spencer is best known for voicing Summer Smith in the animated series Rick and Morty. Aside from being a busy actress, Spencer is also a loving mom to her son, Emmett Emmanual Hesketh, with husband James Hesketh. Emmett also happens to be Kelsey’s first grandchild.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rick And Morty: We're Still Waiting For These Questions To Be Answered</a></span></p><p>And while she may already have a brood of&nbsp;her own, it seems that Spencer has maintained a close relationship with her father. In fact, when Spencer got involved in an incident outside a restaurant in New York City, it was Kelsey who decided to clear things up after reports surfaced that Spencer was injured. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">While speaking with People</a>, the actor clarified that his daughter “was not slashed,” adding that “she is fine.”</p><h2 id=greer-grammer-would-love-to-work-with-her-dad-on-the-frasier-reboot>Greer Grammer Would Love To Work With Her Dad On The Frasier Reboot</h2><p>Just like Spencer, Greer had also decided to pursue acting, becoming known for her role in the MTV series Awkward before taking on other roles later on. More recently, Greer starred in the thriller Deadly Illusions, which became one of the most-watched movies on <a href=#>Netflix</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the moment, the actress is also set to appear in at least two upcoming films. Nonetheless, Greer has also been open about wanting to star in the highly anticipated Frasier reboot although she’s been hesitant about asking her dad for a role in his show. “I don’t know how to ask that even though you think that I would, that that would be a no-brainer. Like, ‘Dad! Get me a role!’ but I’m always so nervous asking my dad for things,” the actress confessed<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;during a Q&A session&nbsp;with HollywoodLife</a>. Greer also explained that “nepotism has never been a thing” in their family. “My dad was always like, ‘You need to work to get your own jobs,’ which is great, but would love to be on Fraiser!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mason-grammer-admitted-that-her-parents-divorce-was-hard-on-her>Mason Grammer Admitted That Her Parents’ Divorce Was Hard On Her</h2><p>Mason is Kelsey’s daughter with ex-wife Camille Grammer and for this young model, seeing her parents’ marriage crumble in front of the cameras (Camille had been a regular presence on <a href=#>The Real Housewives </a>of Beverly Hills). “It was the hardest time of my life,” Mason said while speaking with Genlux. “I changed a lot after that. I had to grow up faster because I had a lot more responsibilities. My dad wasn’t around, so I didn’t see him much, and my mom had such a hard time.” Mason also said that following the divorce, she became her “younger brother’s [Jude] mom.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mason also shared that ever since their split, Camille and Kelsey “still don’t talk. At all. Ever.” That said, she herself have since started communicating with her famous father again, even sharing that she “can talk to him about everything now.” At the same time, Mason has also revealed that she wants to work behind the scenes, just like her dad has from time to time. “I definitely want to go to college. I want to study film,” she told The Daily Dish. “I want to become a director, so we'll see how that works out 'cause that's my true passion. But I enjoy doing this [modeling] right now; it's really fun.”</p><p>Meanwhile, not much is known about Kelsey’s younger children although the actor once gave insight on life with kids. “They discover things every day,” Kelsey told Fox News. “It’s wonderful.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills Ranked From Oldest To Youngest</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the day, Kelsey is just like every other parent, struggling to balance career and family every day. It was something that posed quite a challenge, especially in the past. “I hadn’t quite discovered the idea that you can take the luxury of making sure your personal life is fulfilling at the same time your professional life is [when I was younger],” the actor admitted while speaking with ET. “Sometimes, one or the other is sacrificed a bit, but hopefully you achieve a balance with that and your kids are able to understand that, ‘Yeah dad worked and we’re glad he did.’”</p><p>Today, the actor is doing what he can to be the best father possible and that means being present in all of his children’s lives no matter how hard that can be. “I think, if I’m not with my kids, honestly, I regret that, “but I know that’s part of life and I need to do my job as a person too and set a good example for them,” Kelsey explained. “You have to show up more. You know if you don’t show up, you don’t stay in people’s consciousness.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here’s Why Lisa Kudrow Was Fired From ‘Frasier’… And How She Got ‘Friends’ The Same Year</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqSjmsZus9GapKadomKwqbXLnamepl2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
