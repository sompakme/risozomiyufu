Allen, meanwhile, stood nearby the Barely Lethal actress, wearing a white tee, jeans and white sneakers.</p><p>The twosome were seen getting out of a black SUV on Thursday before they enjoyed a night out in Manhattan. In one snap, <a href=#>the NFL player</a> put his arm around the True Grit star as they weaved through the crowd.</p><p>Allen’s evening with Steinfeld came one month after rumors surfaced that he and longtime girlfriend <strong>Brittany Williams</strong> split after eight years together.</p><p>Eagle-eyed fans noticed in April that Williams, 27, quietly unfollowed the <a href=#>two-time Pro Bowler</a> on social media. The Fresno State University alum also deleted all of her photos with Allen from their relationship.</p><p>The former University of Wyoming quarterback, for his part, still has a few snaps of Williams on his Instagram page, <a href=#>including a birthday tribute to his hometown sweetheart</a> from April 2020. “I hope your day was amazing as you, here’s to 24 and more! ❤️,” he wrote at the time.</p><p>However, as of May he no longer follows the former college cheerleader — and she is not tagged in any of his pictures. (Neither the professional athlete nor Williams have publicly commented on the breakup speculation.)</p><p>Allen <a href=#>first met Williams when they were 8 years old</a> at a birthday party for the NFL star’s brother. While the Pilates instructor asked Allen to be her date to the Sadie Hawkins dance in high school, they didn’t actually give their relationship a chance until freshman year of college in 2015.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The pair made it through a long-distance romance and Williams was later by Allen’s side when he was drafted into the NFL in 2018. She later moved to New York to be with her partner, but earlier this spring they seemingly hit a bump in the road.</p><p>Steinfeld, for her part, was linked to <a href=#><strong>Niall Horan</strong></a> in early 2018. The duo <a href=#>called it quits</a> before the new year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmZmhsqZ50q2coqaWmrmledKppq2slZl6uLXToWSjp6OdeqK4y56lZpmdnrFurtGemKStoGK%2FtrnOq6po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
